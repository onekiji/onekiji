# Uncertainty Clouds Ukraine's Path to NATO Membership Ahead of Summit 

Ukraine's hopes of fast-tracking its NATO membership appear to be dwindling as key alliance members show reluctance due to the ongoing conflict with Russia. The NATO leaders are set to convene in Vilnius, Lithuania, this week where Ukraine hopes to secure a robust security package.

Despite reassurances of continued military aid from the US, UK, France, and Germany, the pathway to membership seems uncertain. This has left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's camp skeptical about receiving a clear roadmap to joining the 31-country military bloc.

US President Joe Biden indicated in a recent CNN interview that Ukraine is not yet prepared for NATO membership, citing the need for time to fulfill the qualifications. Biden also floated the idea of the US providing military aid similar to its long-term support for Israel.

Despite the setbacks, there is political consensus that Ukraine should eventually be granted membership. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reaffirmed that "Ukraine will become a member of NATO". However, experts warn such a pledge might incentivize Moscow to prolong the conflict.

Ahead of the summit, last-minute discussions are anticipated regarding potential fresh security guarantees, encompassing long-term weapon supplies and economic support.
