# Serbia Withdraws Troops from Kosovo Border Following US Warnings

In a significant move, Serbia has pulled back some of its troops from the Kosovo border after receiving warnings from the United States. The White House had expressed concern over what it described as an "unprecedented" buildup of Serbian forces and armored vehicles near the border.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić confirmed the decision, stating that any military action would be counterproductive. The pullback follows recent tensions marked by the killing of a Kosovar police officer and a shootout at a monastery. The long-standing enmity between Serbia and Kosovo has its roots in the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and has flared up in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in years.

While the immediate crisis seems to have been averted, underlying tensions between the two nations remain high, tracing back to conflicts from the 1990s. The United States continues to monitor the situation closely and has not ruled out punitive measures against Serbia if tensions escalate again.
