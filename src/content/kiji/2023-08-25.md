# U.S. Expands F-16 Training for Ukrainian Pilots Amid Rising Tensions

The United States will commence training of Ukrainian pilots for F-16 fighter jets this fall, the Pentagon announced. The move aims to accelerate support for Ukraine amid increased requests from Kyiv and ongoing tensions with Russia. The training, led by the Air National Guard’s 162nd Wing, will be held at Morris Air National Guard Base near Tucson, Arizona, beginning in October.

The decision marks a significant expansion of the U.S. role in Ukraine's military training, which has been predominantly led by European nations like Denmark and the Netherlands. “We want to do everything we can to help move this effort along as quickly as possible in support of Ukraine,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary.

The announcement comes as Ukrainian forces face challenges in their military operations, intensifying the country's demand for greater air power. Ukraine has also signed deals with Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United States to train a substantial number of pilots through early 2024.
