# Iranian Activist Narges Mohammadi to Begin Hunger Strike During Nobel Prize Ceremony

Narges Mohammadi, an acclaimed Iranian activist and recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has announced a hunger strike to coincide with the Nobel Prize ceremony in Oslo. Mohammadi, a vocal critic of Iran's compulsory hijab law and the death penalty, has been imprisoned for her activism.

Her family revealed that Mohammadi's hunger strike is an act of solidarity with other political prisoners in Iran and a protest against human rights violations. Despite her absence, the Nobel Prize will be awarded this Sunday, recognizing her extensive work in promoting human rights and freedom of expression in Iran.

Mohammadi's decision to start a hunger strike during such a significant moment highlights the ongoing struggle for human rights in Iran. The international community has expressed concern over her imprisonment and health, urging Iranian authorities to reconsider her case and the broader situation of political prisoners in the country.

This gesture by Mohammadi underscores the resilience and dedication of activists worldwide, who often face great personal risk to fight for justice and freedom.
