# Canadian House Speaker Resigns Amid Controversy Over WWII Veteran Praise

Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Anthony Rota, announced his resignation after facing backlash for praising Yaroslav Hunka, a 98-year-old Ukrainian-Canadian veteran who had ties to a Nazi military unit during World War II. Rota's acknowledgment of Hunka last week had initially prompted a standing ovation in the parliament.

Following the event, several human rights and Jewish organizations, including B’nai Brith Canada, condemned Rota's recognition. They highlighted Hunka's service in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, a Nazi military unit declared criminal by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946.

Expressing deep regret for his oversight, Rota said in parliament, "That public recognition has caused pain to individuals and communities, including the Jewish community in Canada and around the world." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the incident as "deeply embarrassing" for the nation.

Amidst the controversy, Poland's education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, has expressed intentions to extradite Hunka. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center noted that the incident also distracted from the significant unity displayed between Canada and Ukraine.
