# Iran Moves Five Iranian-Americans to House Arrest Amid Financial Deal

In a significant development amid ongoing negotiations, Iran has transferred five Iranian-American detainees from prison to house arrest. This move comes as part of a tentative agreement with the U.S., involving the release of $6 billion to $7 billion that had been frozen in South Korea due to sanctions.

The transfer of funds, set to pass through Qatar before reaching Iran, is expected to finalize within the next month. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed optimism about the development, suggesting it could signal "the beginning of the end" for the detainees' ordeal.

However, the arrangement has not been free from criticism. Detractors argue that the Biden administration may be inadvertently bolstering the Iranian economy at a time when Tehran poses increasing threats to U.S. interests in the Middle East.

While families of the detainees have welcomed the news, they maintain their resolve, emphasizing that their loved ones are not truly free until they're back on American soil. U.S.-based lawyer Jared Genser cautioned that there are still no guarantees for the detainees' future.

Ongoing negotiations are separate from discussions over Iran's nuclear program. However, insiders suggest that a successful resolution could potentially facilitate talks in other contentious areas.
