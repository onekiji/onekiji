# U.S. GOP Scrambles for New Speaker After McCarthy's Ouster Amid Party Strife

In an unprecedented move, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. Patrick McHenry, currently serving as speaker pro tempore, announced plans for a candidates' forum to elect a new speaker next week. As the GOP grapples with internal divisions, the next speaker will face challenges such as government funding deadlines and a divided stance on aid for Ukraine.

The removal of McCarthy has also led to internal strife within the party, with warnings and threats being issued to GOP members who supported the ouster. Names like Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have emerged as potential candidates. The full House votes on the speaker, and with Democrats expected to oppose any Republican candidate unanimously, the GOP must find consensus on their own.

The clock is ticking, both for the party and for legislative priorities. Amid the chaos, the Republican party is faced with the task of unifying its ranks and moving forward.
