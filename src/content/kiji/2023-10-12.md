# US and Qatar Agree to Withhold $6 Billion from Iran

The United States and Qatar have reached a 'quiet understanding' to temporarily withhold $6 billion in Iranian funds currently stored in Qatari accounts. This decision comes after the recent violent attacks led by Hamas in Israel.

The funds, initially transferred to Qatar as part of a deal to free American detainees in Iran, will not be accessible to Iran for the time being. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo confirmed this stance to House Democrats, adding that Washington retains the right to freeze these accounts completely.

The agreement aims to exercise financial leverage over Iran following its support for violent activities in the Middle East, even as discussions on the fate of the funds continue behind closed doors.
