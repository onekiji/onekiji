# France Prepares Evacuation as Niger Coup Raises Alarm and Gains Local Support

In the wake of the coup in Niger that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, France is preparing to evacuate its nationals, citing violence against the French Embassy and the closure of Niger's airspace. The coup has gained support from neighboring West African countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also under military rule.

The coup, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani on July 26, has resulted in a visible shift in public sentiment towards Russia and away from the West. Pro-Russian sentiment has swept across the country, with protests and public demonstrations featuring the Russian flag.

Bazoum, a staunch ally of the West, had been instrumental in the fight against militant Islamists. His ousting has stirred uncertainty, with some fearing that the political shift could embolden extremist violence and disrupt regional stability.

In response to the coup, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) announced travel and economic sanctions against Niger, threatening military intervention if Bazoum is not reinstated within a week. This has been condemned by Mali and Burkina Faso, who have expressed support for Niger's junta and rejected the application of these sanctions.

As the crisis deepens, many Nigeriens are hoping for peace and stability, while the international community watches with concern. The future direction of Niger and its impact on the fight against Islamist extremism remains uncertain.
