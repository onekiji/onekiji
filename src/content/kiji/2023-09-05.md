# Cuba Exposes Human Trafficking Ring Sending Cubans to Fight in Ukraine

Cuban authorities have unveiled a human trafficking operation originating from Russia, aimed at recruiting Cuban citizens to fight for Russian forces in Ukraine. The revelation comes after local Miami media reported on Cubans being lured to Russia under false pretenses.

Two 19-year-old Cubans revealed in an interview that they were deceived into traveling to Russia. They were promised construction jobs, a $2,200 salary, Russian passports, and the possibility of relocating their families to Russia in the future. However, they were later informed they would be sent to Ukraine to fight.

The Cuban foreign ministry stated that it is actively working to neutralize this trafficking ring and has urged Cubans to be vigilant.
