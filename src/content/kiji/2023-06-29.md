# Putin's Power Play Amid Wagner Rebellion

In a series of events following the Wagner rebellion, Russian General Sergei Surovikin, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces and Deputy Commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine, has been arrested. This came to light after a Kremlin-aligned blogger, Vladimir Romanov, reported the arrest on June 25, claiming Surovikin is held at the Lefortovo Detention Centre in Moscow.

The nature of Surovikin's involvement in the rebellion remains unclear, with some sources alleging his allegiance to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the financier of the Wagner Private Military Company (PMC). The U.S. is currently investigating whether Surovikin had a hand in planning the coup.

The rebellion saw the deployment of 25,000 mercenaries by Prigozhin after he claimed a missile strike on his camps by the Russian army. This move triggered fears in the Russian presidential administration of a potential conflict near Moscow, leading to Putin's urgent departure for his residence in Valdai.

However, the situation took a turn when Prigozhin announced the withdrawal of his forces after a conversation with Alexander Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed President of Belarus. The Kremlin later announced the closure of the criminal case against Prigozhin, stating he would "go to Belarus".

Amid the chaos, President Putin thanked the Wagner Group and law enforcement agencies for "suppressing" the rebellion and preventing "fratricidal bloodshed". The incident, therefore, appears to be part of a larger effort by Putin to consolidate his authority, even as questions remain about the whereabouts and roles of Russia's top generals.
