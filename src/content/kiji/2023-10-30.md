# Antisemitic Riot at Dagestan Airport Sparks Controversy

An antisemitic riot broke out at Makhachkala airport in Dagestan, Russia, as an angry mob sought Jewish passengers from a flight arriving from Israel. Russia blames Ukraine for orchestrating the incident, while reports highlight the role of social media in fueling the violence.

On Sunday, an agitated crowd stormed Makhachkala airport in the predominantly Muslim region of Dagestan, targeting Jewish passengers arriving from Tel Aviv, Israel. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, claimed that the riot was a "provocation" orchestrated from outside Russia and pointed fingers at Ukraine.

Conversely, social media is under scrutiny for its role in the incident. Details of the inbound flight from Tel Aviv were disseminated through popular social media platforms, instigating the mob action.

The incident has sparked international concern, raising questions about the influence of external actors and social media in instigating hate crimes. Further investigations are underway.
