# IAEA Defends Report Amid Controversy Over Fukushima's Treated Water Release

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has defended the scientific accuracy of the agency's report permitting Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. This comes amid claims of disagreement among the international experts who contributed to the report.

China's Global Times suggested Liu Senlin, a Chinese expert in the IAEA's working group, voiced disappointment with the report, describing it as "hasty". However, Grossi stated that none of the experts had raised concerns directly with him.

Despite reassurances from Japan and the IAEA that the release will have a negligible environmental impact, China criticized the plan, citing potential risks to marine life and human health. Grossi responded by saying that the IAEA's report is not an endorsement of Japan's plan but merely states it aligns with existing standards.

Before its release, Japan will filter the water to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium. The treated water will then be diluted to meet internationally approved levels. The water discharge, which could impact Japan's seafood exports, is expected to take up to 40 years.
