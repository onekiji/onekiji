# Wildfires Threaten Canada's Yellowknife and Surrounding Communities

A rapidly approaching wildfire has prompted the evacuation of Yellowknife, one of Canada's largest northern cities. Officials have given the city's 20,000 residents until noon Friday to leave, as the wildfire is a mere 17 km away and could reach the outskirts by the weekend.

Hay River, another community, is under similar threat, with Mayor Kandis Jameson noting that the only two exit highways are now closed due to the fire's rapid advance. Personal accounts depict a harrowing escape, with vehicles melting and smoke obscuring vision as residents flee.

Amid over 200 wildfires, the Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency. The Canadian military is actively assisting in tackling the blazes and evacuating residents. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to support the affected region.

The ongoing heatwave in Western Canada has broken 19 daily heat records, fueling these uncontrollable wildfires. Fires have raged across nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, disrupting activities and necessitating federal and international firefighting resources. Residents are urged to heed evacuation notices and remain calm.
