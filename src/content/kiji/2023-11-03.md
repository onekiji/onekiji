# Global Climate Crisis Response Falls Short, UN Warns

The United Nations has issued a dire warning that the world is significantly underprepared for the ongoing impacts of the climate crisis, which is already affecting billions globally. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has revealed a stark discrepancy between the funds needed for climate adaptation in vulnerable countries and the actual financial support provided, highlighting that current international funding is merely 5-10% of the required amount.

The UNEP report estimates that poor and vulnerable countries need between $215 billion to $387 billion annually for this decade to adapt to the climate crisis. However, in 2021, the funding dropped by 15% to only $21 billion, falling short of the $40 billion promised by wealthy nations at the 2021 UN climate summit in Glasgow.

As the world heads into the Cop28 summit, the urgency to provide adequate adaptation measures to safeguard populations from the escalating effects of climate change has never been more critical. The funding shortfall calls for immediate action to bridge the gap and fulfill the pledges made to combat this global threat.
