# Flooding Catastrophe in Libya Claims Over 6,000 Lives

The death toll from a massive flooding disaster in the Mediterranean city of Derna, Libya, has surpassed 6,000, according to recent updates. The calamity occurred after the collapse of two dams, leading to widespread devastation.

Search teams have been tirelessly scouring streets, ruined buildings, and even the sea to recover bodies. The city has faced significant challenges in receiving aid due to washed-away access roads.

Morgues are overwhelmed, and the city is racing to bury the dead as bodies continue to pile up. Aid workers who managed to reach the city are doing their utmost to provide relief to the survivors.

The international community is urged to assist in the ongoing relief efforts as the situation remains dire.
