# Niger Under Tension Following Coup and Western Condemnation

Niger is in a state of turmoil following a military coup led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani last week, which saw the ousting of President Mohamed Bazoum. Hundreds rallied in support of the junta on Niger's independence day, expressing anti-French sentiments and raising concerns about the future fight against extremism in Africa's Sahel region.

The coup has drawn sharp condemnation from Western countries, including the U.S., and the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, which has threatened forceful removal of the junta if power is not returned to Bazoum. In response, European countries, including France and the U.S., have begun to evacuate their citizens from Niger.

The new military ruler, Gen. Tchiani, has dismissed the ECOWAS-imposed sanctions and called for the population to stand ready to defend the nation. His defiance, alongside a looming deadline of August 6 set by ECOWAS for the reinstatement of Bazoum, has heightened tensions.

Niger is a significant uranium producer and a crucial ally in the fight against jihadist extremism in the Sahel. Its current crisis has drawn attention to the power dynamics in the region, with some neighboring countries like Mali and Burkina Faso turning toward Russia after similar military takeovers.

The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reached out to the ousted President Bazoum, affirming U.S. commitment to restoring Niger's democratically elected government. Despite a partial evacuation, the U.S. embassy in Niamey remains open, demonstrating a continued commitment to the people of Niger.

As the international community watches with bated breath, it remains uncertain whether the junta will align with Moscow or maintain Niger's Western partnerships. The coup, coupled with growing anti-French sentiments and a rising affinity for Russia, has made this question central to Niger's unfolding political crisis.
