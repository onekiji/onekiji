# Mass Protests Break Out as Israel Limits Supreme Court Powers

In a controversial move, Israel's parliament passed an amendment limiting the Supreme Court's powers to invalidate some government decisions. The bill, part of a broader judicial overhaul proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, passed with a 64-0 vote following a walk-out by opposition lawmakers.

This legislative change, described as necessary by Netanyahu to balance government branches, has sparked widespread civil unrest. Thousands of protestors took to the streets across the country, leading to clashes with police and numerous arrests. The decision has divided the country and sparked concerns from allies abroad regarding Israel's democratic health.

Despite mounting protests, Netanyahu defended the amendment, asserting that it will not undermine the country's democracy or the judiciary's independence. He also expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue with the opposition to reach a comprehensive agreement by November's end.

However, critics argue the amendment could lead to abuses of power by removing checks on the executive's authority. Opposition leaders, along with a political watchdog group, announced plans to challenge the law at the Supreme Court.

The fallout from the decision was immediate and widespread. The shekel and Tel Aviv's main share indices fell, while various sectors, including military reservists and the country's largest labor federation, threatened strikes and boycotts.

The White House has called on Israeli leaders to work toward "as broad a consensus as possible" through political dialogue. Despite the international and internal pressure, Netanyahu's government remains steadfast in its intentions to continue with the planned judicial changes.
