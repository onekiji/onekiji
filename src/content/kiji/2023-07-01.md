# UN Ends Decade-Long Peacekeeping Mission in Mali Amid Rising Tensions

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) unanimously voted to conclude its 10-year peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, on June 30, 2023. The decision comes after the West African nation's military junta abruptly requested the 13,000-strong force to exit the country, a move the US alleges was orchestrated by Russia's Wagner mercenary group.

MINUSMA has been instrumental in safeguarding civilians against an Islamist insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties. However, the abrupt termination of the mission could potentially escalate the security situation in the country, leaving Mali's military, considered under-equipped, to fight against militants alongside approximately 1,000 Wagner fighters.

The UNSC adopted a French-drafted resolution which mandates MINUSMA to begin "the cessation of its operations, transfer of its tasks, as well as the orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal of its personnel" with a completion deadline of December 31, 2023. The resolution further authorizes MINUSMA to respond to immediate threats of violence to civilians and contribute to the safe, civilian-led delivery of humanitarian assistance until September 30, 2023.

The US has accused Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner, of facilitating the departure of the UN peacekeepers from Mali. The White House stated that it possesses information indicating Mali's authorities have paid over $200 million to Wagner since late 2021.

Russia, on the other hand, has expressed support for Mali's "sovereign decision," reiterating its commitment to assisting the country in stabilizing the situation on a bilateral basis. Mali's government has pledged to ensure compliance with the withdrawal timeline and remains open to cooperation with all partners, provided they respect the principles of their state policies.
