# Sierra Leone Restores Calm After Barracks Attack; Leaders Detained

In a swift response to Sunday's unexpected attack on a military barracks in Freetown, Sierra Leone, President Julius Maada Bio announced the arrest of most of the insurgency's leaders. The attack, which included attempts to seize military armory and assault a prison, led to a nation-wide curfew amid gunfire across the capital.

The president assured citizens of restored calm, emphasizing ongoing security operations and investigations. Former President Ernest Bai Koroma reported an attack on his residence, resulting in the death of a military guard and the abduction of another.

The situation escalated as armed men commandeered a police vehicle near Wilberforce barracks, and residents remained indoors due to the curfew. The attackers, spotted in military fatigues, claimed their actions were targeted at "cleaning" the society and not harming civilians.

This unrest follows President Bio's re-election in June, a decision contested by the opposition and scrutinized internationally. The recent turmoil echoes Sierra Leone's history of violence, including last year's anti-government protests that resulted in numerous casualties.

The international community, including the US, EU, and regional bodies, condemned the attacks, while the nation's civil aviation authority advised flight rescheduling. The incident marks another chapter in West Africa's history of political instability, with neighboring countries also experiencing military coups.
