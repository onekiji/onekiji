# EU Grain Ban Lifted, Eastern Nations Rebel

The European Union's decision to lift a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain exports has met with resistance from Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. These countries announced they will extend their national bans on Ukrainian grain imports, defying EU directives.

Initially placed in May, the EU's ban aimed to protect Eastern European farmers from being undercut by an influx of cheap Ukrainian grain. The move comes after Ukraine, a significant grain supplier, had to rely on its neighbors for exports due to Black Sea route limitations.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that the extension serves "the interests of the Polish farmer." Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban took to social media, accusing Brussels bureaucrats of ignoring European farmers' concerns. Slovakia also expressed its intention to safeguard its domestic market.

Meanwhile, Romanian farmers have called on their government to follow suit, awaiting Ukraine's plan to prevent a market surge. Romania, a key export route for Ukraine, has felt the impact, with a surge of 9.2 million metric tons of grain passing through its Black Sea port of Constanta this year.

The unilateral decisions by Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia may strain relations with the EU, which urges member states to adhere to collective agreements. The defiance highlights the tension between national interests and EU policies, particularly when local markets and politics are at stake.
