# Israeli Tourism Minister Visits Riyadh Amidst Signs of Normalization

In a significant diplomatic move, Israeli Tourism Minister Haim Katz visited Riyadh this week, marking the first public visit of an Israeli minister leading a delegation to Saudi Arabia. During the UN World Tourism Organization conference in Riyadh, Saudi Tourism Minister Ahmed bin Aqil al-Khateeb publicly acknowledged the presence of Katz, emphasizing the role of tourism as a "bridge between people and cultures."

The visit comes amidst increasing indications of the two countries edging closer to a normalization agreement. While there was no official meeting reported between the two ministers, Katz held discussions with several foreign officials, including representatives from Monaco, Malta, Albania, and Greece.

The US Biden administration has been actively involved in brokering a potential normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. A potential deal might include a defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and the US and assistance for Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear program. However, progress on the Palestinian issue remains a significant factor in these talks, with both nations emphasizing the need for a two-state solution.
