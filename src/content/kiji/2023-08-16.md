# Taliban's Two-Year Reign: Afghan Women's Lives Forever Altered

Two years after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, their continued rule sees no end, with deep-seated beliefs anchored in Islamic law. Their chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, recently confirmed that bans, including those on female education beyond the sixth grade, would persist. These edicts have stripped Afghan women of their rights to education, employment, and participation in public life.

For many Afghan women, the past two years have been a stark contrast to the freedoms they once enjoyed. Zahra, a 20-year-old former student, reminisces about her life before 2021, filled with friends, studies, and simple joys like bike rides. Now, her life is confined to the four walls of her home, with memories of a brighter past and concerns for an uncertain future. Like many, she represents the heartrending shift in the lives of Afghan women, who are now longing for the liberties and opportunities they once took for granted.
