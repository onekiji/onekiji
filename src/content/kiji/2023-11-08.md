# Russian Artist Faces Harsh Sentence for Anti-War Protest

Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko could spend eight years in a penal colony after a protest against the war in Ukraine. Known as Sasha, she replaced price tags with anti-war messages in a St. Petersburg supermarket. Prosecutors charged her with spreading false information about the Russian military, a crime that can carry a 10 to 15-year sentence. Skochilenko, detained since April 2022, denies the charges, but a shopper's complaint led to her arrest.

The case highlights Russia's stringent laws against dissent, ramped up since the Ukraine conflict began. Critics, like Amnesty International and the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial, call Skochilenko a political prisoner, decrying her treatment and the broader crackdown on opposition. With nearly 20,000 arrests since the war's start, the Russian government continues its aggressive stance against any deviation from the official narrative.
