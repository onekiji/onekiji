# Erdogan and Putin in Talks to Revive Black Sea Grain Deal

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on Monday to discuss reviving a key Black Sea grain deal that had previously been abandoned by Russia.

The original agreement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, facilitated the marketing of Ukrainian grain and helped mitigate a global food crisis. Russia exited the agreement in July of last year, citing hindrances to its own food and fertilizer exports.

The high-level meeting between the two leaders marks a significant development amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. Erdogan expressed optimism post-meeting, stating that the restoration of the deal could happen soon.

Both Russia and Turkey are strategic players in the Black Sea region, and the restoration of this deal could have far-reaching implications for global food security.
