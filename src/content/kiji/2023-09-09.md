# Devastating Earthquake Shakes Marrakesh, Claims Over 1,300 Lives

Marrakesh, Morocco's popular tourist destination, was rocked by a devastating 6.8-magnitude earthquake, resulting in catastrophic loss of life and severe damage to its historic Jewish quarter.

Late at night, the quake struck southwest of Marrakesh, causing residents like Hafida Sahraouia to liken the devastation to a bomb strike. Buildings in mountainous villages and ancient cities crumbled, unable to withstand the quake's force.

The tragedy has so far claimed more than 1,300 lives, and the death toll is expected to rise as rescue operations continue. Hundreds of people were killed in the historic Jewish quarter alone, a significant part of the city's cultural heritage.

Countries worldwide are sending aid and rescue teams to assist in the ongoing relief efforts.

As Marrakesh begins to assess the scale of the devastation, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant for aftershocks while they work to restore normalcy.
