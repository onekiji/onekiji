# Niger's Airspace Closes Amid Tensions Over Military Coup

Niger's airspace was shut down on Sunday due to impending threats of intervention from neighboring countries, following the expiration of a deadline set by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This move came after a military coup in late July where President Mohamed Bazoum was detained, sparking widespread international condemnation from entities such as the US, France, the European Union, and the United Nations.

ECOWAS had given the coup leaders a strict ultimatum to relinquish power by Sunday, with threats of potential military intervention. The regional bloc also implemented sanctions against the junta, which included travel bans and asset freezes.

In a show of defiance and support for the junta, thousands took to the streets of Niamey, Niger's capital. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso and Mali, two neighboring countries, have warned of significant repercussions against any foreign military intervention in Niger.

The political instability in Niger is of global significance, given the country's role as a key uranium producer and its strategic position as a Western ally in combating Islamist militants in the Sahel region.
