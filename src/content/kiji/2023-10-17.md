# India's Supreme Court Declines to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage, Defers to Parliament

India's top court on Tuesday declined to legalize same-sex marriages, stating that the responsibility lies with the Parliament. The decision has been met with disappointment from LGBTQ+ rights activists who had hoped for a landmark ruling.

Chief Justice DY Chandrachud urged the government to uphold the rights of the queer community and end discrimination against them. The court agreed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that the legislature is the appropriate forum for such a contentious issue.

This development adds to the ongoing debate on LGBTQ+ rights in India, which decriminalized homosexuality in 2018 but has yet to recognize same-sex partnerships. Activists argue that the court's decision further marginalizes the queer community, while proponents believe it respects the separation of powers.

For now, the ball is in Parliament's court to decide the future of same-sex marriages in India.
