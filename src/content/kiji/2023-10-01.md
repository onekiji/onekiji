# Turkish Airstrikes Target Kurdish Militants in Iraq Following Ankara Suicide Attack

In a swift response to a suicide bombing in Ankara, Turkish warplanes conducted airstrikes on suspected Kurdish militant bases in northern Iraq. Turkey's defense ministry confirmed the operation, stating that around 20 targets linked to the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK) were destroyed, including caves, shelters, and depots.

The bombing attack in Ankara occurred in front of Turkish government buildings, resulting in the death of both attackers and injuring two police officers. Authorities have called this the first terrorist attack in the capital in years. A Kurdish militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Both incidents have escalated tensions and security concerns, leading to a heightened state of alert in Turkey.
