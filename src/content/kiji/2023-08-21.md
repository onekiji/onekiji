# Ecuador's Presidential Election: Gonzalez Leads Amid Political Unrest

Left-wing candidate Luisa Gonzalez is currently leading the presidential polls in Ecuador with 33% of votes, as nearly 80% of ballots have been counted. Her closest competitor, businessman Daniel Noboa, trails with 24%. The two will face off in a run-off election on 15 October.

The election has been marred by significant political unrest, most notably the assassination of candidate Fernando Villavicencio on 9 August in Quito. This tragic event, coupled with several other violent incidents leading up to the election day, has heightened concerns over the rising political violence in the nation.

Despite these challenges, Sunday's voting process was largely peaceful, with an impressive security presence of around 100,000 police officers and soldiers. The election was necessitated after President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the parliament to avert an impeachment.

Economic challenges also loom over the election, as the country grapples with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and a struggling economy. The Central Bank of Ecuador has downgraded its growth forecast for 2023 from 3.1% to 2.6%.

In addition to the presidential election, citizens were also voting on two ballot measures related to environmental concerns, specifically on oil extraction and mineral exploitation.

The newly elected president will take office on 26 October and will serve the remainder of Lasso's term, which is 18 months. The election results are not only crucial for the political direction of Ecuador but also for restoring peace and stability in a nation currently grappling with significant challenges.
