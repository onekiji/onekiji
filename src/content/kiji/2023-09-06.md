# G20 Invite Sparks Debate Over India's Name Change to 'Bharat

A recent G20 dinner invitation by Indian President Droupadi Murmu has sparked widespread debate over a possible change in the country's name. The English version of the invite referred to Murmu as the "President of Bharat," deviating from the traditional use of "India" in English-language documents.

Critics argue that this move aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist ideology and push for increased use of Hindi. An official from the president's office declined to comment on the issue, leaving room for speculation.

Given the varying perspectives, the question remains: is India on the brink of being officially renamed 'Bharat'?
