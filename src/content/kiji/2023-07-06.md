# Meta Launches Twitter Rival 'Threads', Garnering 10 Million Users in Seven Hours

Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has introduced Threads, a new social media platform aiming to challenge Twitter. Within the first seven hours of its launch, the app logged 10 million sign-ups, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Users can access Threads using their Instagram credentials, making it a seamless addition for Instagram's 2 billion active users.

Designed to be a less toxic version of Twitter, Threads has similar features such as short text posts that can be liked, reposted, and replied to, but lacks direct messaging capabilities. Posts can be up to 500 characters long and include photos and videos up to five minutes long. 

The launch comes at a time when Twitter is facing a significant setback under Elon Musk's ownership, with plunging value and controversial content moderation. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, has expressed optimism that Threads could become a platform with over a billion users, something he believes Twitter has failed to achieve.

Meta is allowing users to sign up without ads and is considering making Threads compatible with open, interoperable social networks. It also has taken steps to ensure the safety of underage users, defaulting those under 18 to a private profile.
