# Israel Imposes 'Complete Siege' on Gaza Amid Rising Tensions with Hamas

In a rapidly escalating conflict, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a military response "like never before" against Hamas. This follows a surprise attack by the militant group in Israeli territory over the weekend. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has ordered a "complete siege" on Gaza, cutting off water, food, and power supplies.

Hamas, in turn, has threatened to kill civilian hostages if Israel proceeds with airstrikes without prior warning. Reports indicate that some hostages have already been killed in the ongoing Israeli strikes.

The international community is watching closely as the situation unfolds, with concerns about a potential humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the escalating loss of life on both sides.
