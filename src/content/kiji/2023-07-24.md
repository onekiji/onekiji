# Spain's Snap Election Results in Hung Parliament, Coalition Talks Ahead

Spain's snap general election concluded with the right-wing Popular Party (PP) emerging as the winner, but falling short of a parliamentary majority. As 100% of the votes were counted, the PP obtained 136 seats, while the incumbent Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) secured 122 seats in the 350-seat lower chamber.

With neither party reaching the required 176 seats for a majority, coalition talks are now underway. The PP would need support from several smaller parties, including the far-right Vox party, to form a government. However, even with Vox's partnership, they remain seven seats short.

The far-left Sumar alliance, supporting the PSOE, won 31 seats, making any coalition with Sanchez just 153 seats in total.

The inclusion of the far-right Vox party in a potential coalition has raised concerns, as it would mark the first time such a party has entered government in Spain since the 1970s. Many smaller parties are expected to resist joining this coalition.

Additionally, the two Catalan pro-independence parties, while seeing a decline in seats, could play a crucial role in forming a government if Sanchez seeks to remain prime minister. However, their demands for a referendum on Catalonia's independence might be a hurdle.

Negotiations to form a coalition government will commence soon, with both sides vying to secure allies. If no majority is reached within two months, Spain could face another election.

Spain's political landscape hangs in the balance, and uncertainty looms as parties strive to shape the country's future direction.
