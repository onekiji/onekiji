# Major Israeli Military Operation in West Bank's Jenin Escalates Violence

In a significant escalation of violence in the West Bank, Israeli forces initiated a major operation in the city of Jenin, involving hundreds of troops, drones, and resulting in a significant gun battle. The operation, which started overnight on Sunday, caused at least five deaths and injured 27 others, seven of whom are critically injured, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry​.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) described the operation as an "extensive counterterrorism effort," targeting a joint operational command center for the Jenin Camp and operatives of the Jenin Brigade, a Palestinian militant group associated with Islamic Jihad. The IDF stated that this center served as an advanced observation and reconnaissance center, a weapons and explosives site, and a shelter for individuals involved in recent terror attacks.

Footage from the scene showed continued operations in parts of the Jenin refugee camp and wounded Palestinians being evacuated by ambulance to Jenin Government Hospital. Reports indicated that at least one Israeli soldier was slightly injured by shrapnel from a grenade used during the incursion.

The IDF has reported that the goal of the operation is to disrupt the "safe haven" mentality within the Jenin camp, which it described as a "hornet's nest" and source of around 50 shooting attacks against Israelis. The Palestinian Authority and Jordan were informed about the incursion in advance.

The Jenin Brigade claimed that it had damaged at least one Israeli military vehicle with improvised explosive devices, and its militants continue to clash with Israeli forces. In response to the operation, Palestinian Islamic Jihad pledged to confront its enemy "with all possible retaliation options," while Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the military action as a "new war crime"​.
