# US Forces Respond to Widespread Attacks in Iraq with Strikes in Syria

In a series of incidents marking the most extensive attacks on US forces since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict, US personnel stationed across Iraq were targeted without suffering any casualties. The attacks, which took place on Thursday, involved an explosive device near Mosul, armed drones at the al-Harir and Ain al-Asad airbases, and a fire at a fuel depot. The Pentagon attributes these attacks to groups backed by Iran, a claim Iran denies.

In response, the US executed precision airstrikes in eastern Syria against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its affiliates, targeting a weapons storage facility believed to be instrumental in the assaults on US forces. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated these actions were self-defense, emphasizing America's readiness to protect its personnel and interests. The US has also taken additional security measures at its bases and remains in communication with regional partners and Iran to prevent escalation.

The recent confrontations underscore a tense regional climate as the US bolsters its Middle East presence with additional firepower and defensive measures, all while navigating the delicate balance of the ongoing Israel-Hamas hostilities.
