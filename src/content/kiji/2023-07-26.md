# US Secretary of State Visits Tonga, Addresses Chinese Influence

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Tonga, marking the first such visit by a US Secretary of State. During his visit, Blinken criticized China's "problematic behavior" and "predatory" economic activities in the region, warning about Beijing's increasing influence.

Blinken met with Tongan Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni, discussing strategic matters related to the Pacific region. He emphasized US commitment to supporting Pacific nations and addressing issues such as climate change, development, and illegal fishing. He also highlighted the importance of transparent and sustainable financing for investments in the region.

Furthermore, Blinken expressed concern over China's growing presence in the Pacific, saying it often comes with strings attached. He stressed that while the US has no objection to China's engagement in the region, it is critical that investments are transparent and conducted in a manner that does not undermine good governance or promote corruption.

Blinken's trip is part of a broader diplomatic push by the US in the Pacific, as evidenced by the opening of new US embassies in the region, including the one in Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa. This visit comes amidst increasing Western aid and engagement in the region, a response to Beijing's growing influence.

Tonga, a Polynesian archipelago with about 100,000 inhabitants, is heavily indebted to Beijing. The country has recently started to pay down its debt. Despite the US's concerns, Prime Minister Sovaleni stated that Tonga had no concerns about its relationship with China, which is focused on infrastructure development.

Following his visit to Tonga, Blinken will head to Wellington, New Zealand, and then to Brisbane, Australia for meetings with defense officials. This visit is the latest in a series of diplomatic efforts by the US to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific.
