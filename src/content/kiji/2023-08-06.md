# Escalation in Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Key Facilities Targeted

Amidst increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, three individuals were reported dead following a series of intense air raids and shelling. This escalation comes on the heels of a strike by Kyiv on a Russian tanker situated in the Black Sea.

Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, strongly condemned a Russian attack on a blood transfusion centre in Kupiansk, located in the Kharkiv region. Labeling it as a "war crime," Zelenskiy revealed that the facility was hit by a "guided air bomb," leading to both fatalities and injuries. Rescue teams are currently working to control the resultant blaze.

In another incident, a significant factory was also targeted. These events transpired shortly after Moscow had terminated an agreement last month, which had facilitated grain export from Ukraine despite the ongoing hostilities.

Global leaders, representing 40 nations including the US, China, and India, are presently convening in Saudi Arabia. Their objective is to deliberate on potential solutions to the protracted war in Ukraine. However, no final declaration is anticipated from this assembly.
