# Israel Signals Readiness for Comprehensive Ground Offensive in Gaza

Israel's defense officials have indicated their readiness for a ground offensive into Gaza, described as more "comprehensive and ferocious" than previous conflicts with Hamas. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on the Gaza border, "You will soon see it from inside. The command will come."

This development comes after a Hamas attack on October 7 that resulted in over 1,400 Israeli deaths, mostly civilians. Israel has since mobilized 360,000 reservists and amassed a large military presence around Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed Gallant's sentiment, stating, "This is our darkest hour." Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting with his British counterpart, Rishi Sunak.

U.S. President Joe Biden, who recently left Israel after discussions, backed Israel's position, drawing a parallel between Hamas and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, "They both want to annihilate a neighboring democracy."

Israel is also reinforcing its northern border against potential threats from Hezbollah in Lebanon. The conflict has already resulted in more than 3,000 Palestinian deaths from aerial bombardments over the past 12 days.
