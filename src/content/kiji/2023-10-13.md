# Australians Reject Constitutional Change for First Nations in Referendum

In a historic vote, Australians have rejected the first constitutional amendment proposal in 24 years aimed at recognizing Indigenous people and creating an advisory body for government policies affecting them. Preliminary results show that a majority of the 17.6 million registered voters voted 'No.'

The referendum had been championed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who expressed his continued commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, despite the setback. "We are not yes voters or no voters. We are all Australians," he said in a national address.

Early counts revealed that 57% of voters opposed the initiative known as the Indigenous Voice. The referendum needed a majority both nationally and in at least four of the six states to pass but failed to meet these criteria.

Critics from conservative political parties had denounced the proposal as vague and redundant, while supporters argued it was a crucial step toward solving significant challenges in remote Indigenous communities. Public opinion shifted against the proposal in the months leading up to the vote, with opposition intensifying during the 'No' campaign.

Advocates for the change expressed devastation at the outcome. Tanya Hosch, who spent a decade developing the model, said, "Thereâ€™s going to be a lot of pain and hurt."
