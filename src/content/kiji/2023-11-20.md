# Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Seize "Galaxy Leader" Ship, Escalating Regional Tensions

Yemen’s Houthi rebels have escalated regional tensions by seizing the "Galaxy Leader" cargo ship in the Red Sea on November 19. The ship, linked to Israel, was reportedly boarded by armed men via helicopter, according to Galaxy Maritime Ltd, the vessel's owner. The U.S. State Department condemned the seizure as a "flagrant violation of international law," demanding the immediate release of the ship and its 25 crew members, who are nationals from Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Philippines, Mexico, and Romania.

The Houthi rebels claimed the action was in response to the ongoing conflict with Israel and vowed to target ships connected to Israel. The incident raises fears of increased hostilities in a crucial global shipping route. The safety of the crew remains a primary concern, as noted by Galaxy Maritime, which highlighted the seizure as a serious threat to international trade and freedom of passage.

The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations indicated the ship was moved to Yemen's Hodeidah port. This event underscores the volatile nature of the region, with potential implications for global shipping and energy supplies.
