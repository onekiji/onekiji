# Russian Forces Attack Ukrainian Grain Ports amid Global Hunger Concerns

Just a day after pulling out of a United Nations-backed grain export deal, Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks on key Ukrainian ports, including the Black Sea port of Odesa. The move, which Russia described as "mass revenge strikes," follows attacks by Ukrainian seaborne drones on a key bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea.

The fallout of the attacks and Russia's exit from the grain export deal potentially threatens the food security of millions worldwide. "This decision by the Russian Federation will strike a blow to people in need everywhere," warned U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Ukraine's air force reported that it shot down six Kalibr missiles and 31 out of 36 drones, while Russia claimed it had foiled a Ukrainian drone strike on Crimea and reopened a single lane of road traffic on the Crimea bridge.

Meanwhile, Russia has suggested that it might return to the grain deal if its demands for easing rules on its own food and fertilizer exports are met. However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for the grain deal to continue without Russia's participation.

The situation on the ground remains volatile, with both sides reporting heavy fighting. The attacks on the ports, along with the impending global food crisis, underscore the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict.
