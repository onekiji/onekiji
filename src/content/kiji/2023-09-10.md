# U.S. Builds Bridges in Vietnam, Biden Cautions on China's Intentions with Taiwan

In a historic move, President Joe Biden has solidified the United States' partnership with Vietnam, elevating diplomatic ties and securing deals in semiconductors and minerals. The U.S. aims to fortify global supply chains and lessen China-related risks. This comes as Vietnam has also been navigating its complex relations with both Washington and Beijing.

Biden's visit to Vietnam was marked by ceremonies and warm receptions, signifying the long journey the two nations have made from being wartime adversaries to strategic partners. "We can trace a 50-year arc of progress between our nations, from conflict to normalization, to this new elevated status," Biden said during his visit.

Meanwhile, speaking after the G20 leaders' summit in India, Biden expressed skepticism about China's ability to invade Taiwan, citing China's economic downturn as a possible deterrent. The President believes that these economic challenges have left China's leadership with "their hands full," potentially easing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.

This diplomatic tour underscores the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, while also keeping an eye on China's growing influence. As Vietnam seeks its own foothold in global politics and economics, the U.S. continues to evaluate its complex relationships with both allies and competitors.
