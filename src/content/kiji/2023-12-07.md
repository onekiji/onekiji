# US Conducts Flights in Guyana Amid Venezuela Territorial Dispute

The United States announced it will conduct flight operations within Guyana amidst escalating tensions over the oil-rich Essequibo region, disputed between Guyana and Venezuela. This move builds on the U.S.'s routine engagement in the area, coinciding with concerns expressed by Britain and Brazil regarding the growing border conflict.

The territorial dispute, which has a long history, recently intensified, prompting involvement from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Venezuela's recent claims over the Essequibo region, which encompasses a significant portion of Guyana, have led to heightened international attention.

In a recent development, Venezuela detained two Guyanese fishing vessels and their crews, citing illegal fishing activities in Venezuelan waters. This action has further strained relations between the two South American countries, with Guyana demanding the immediate release of the vessels and their crew.

The U.S. flights, seen as a show of support for Guyana, signify an increased international focus on the dispute, with potential implications for regional stability and international law.
