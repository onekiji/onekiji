# Israeli Forces End Operation in Jenin; Gaza Retaliation Follow

Israeli forces have completed a significant military operation in the Palestinian city of Jenin, resulting in the withdrawal of their troops. The action, described as one of the largest in the occupied West Bank in recent years, targeted militant infrastructure and weapons in the densely populated Jenin refugee camp. Twelve Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed during the operation.

Upon the troops' withdrawal, Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip launched five rockets toward Israel. The Israeli military responded by striking an underground weapons manufacturing facility in Gaza. There have been no immediate reports of casualties from these incidents.

During the operation, significant infrastructure damage occurred, and several allegations of excessive force were made, including accusations of firing tear gas at hospitals. Israeli military denied these claims, stating that they were unaware of such incidents but acknowledged that the camp had been used by terrorist organizations as a hideout. International reactions varied, with the U.S. stating that Israel had a right to defend against terrorist groups, while the Palestinian Authority labeled the operation as a "war crime."

This military operation in Jenin signals an escalation in the ongoing tension in the region, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to continue actions to "uproot terrorism." As the dust settles, the long task of reconstruction begins for the residents of the Jenin refugee camp.
