# Chandrayaan-3 Successfully Launched: India's Latest Attempt to Land a Rover on the Moon

The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully launched the Chandrayaan-3, its third lunar probe mission, on Friday, July 15, 2023. The mission aims to land a rover on the moon's south pole, a feat only accomplished by the United States, Russia, and China.

The spacecraft took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota near Chennai and was placed in a precise geostationary orbit. Over the next six weeks, it will traverse approximately 3.84 lakh km to reach the moon, marking a complex journey that includes entering lunar orbit and descending towards the lunar south pole.

The Chandrayaan-3 mission, costing $77 million, is India's second attempt to land a rover on the moon after the Chandrayaan-2 failed due to a thruster malfunction and software issue during landing in 2019. If successful, the solar-powered rover will operate for one lunar day (about two earth weeks), exploring the lunar surface.

Despite operating on a relatively small budget, India's space program has consistently displayed ambition and resourcefulness. With this mission, the country continues to strengthen its presence in the international space community. Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the launch as a "new chapter in India's space odyssey," testament to the scientists' relentless dedication.

The Chandrayaan-3 mission also highlights increased collaboration between India and the U.S., carrying a NASA-built laser retroreflector array. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated ISRO on the launch, expressing anticipation for the scientific results to come from the mission.
