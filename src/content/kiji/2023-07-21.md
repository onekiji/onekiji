# UK Conservatives Sustain By-Election Hits, Yet Retain Uxbridge; Labour and Lib Dems Score Key Victories

Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, maintains that the Conservatives still have a shot in the upcoming general elections, despite recent by-election losses in Selby and Ainsty, and Somerton and Frome. However, the Tories managed to retain the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, sparing Sunak from the embarrassment of losing three by-elections in one night.

The Tory victory in Uxbridge, won by a mere 495 votes, is attributed to local opposition to the planned expansion of the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez) by London's mayor. The results, according to Sunak, demonstrated that voters lean Conservative when faced with the "reality" of Labour in power.

Despite this, the losses underscore a challenging path for the Conservatives in the upcoming general election. Labour's "historic" victory in Selby and a 29% swing to the Liberal Democrats in Somerton and Frome demonstrate a strong demand for change, according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

The results have prompted calls within the Conservative party for a "complete change of direction" and a renewed focus on key issues such as economy, inflation, and illegal migration. Meanwhile, polling expert Sir John Curtice suggests that the Conservatives are in "as deep an electoral hole as the opinion polls have been suggesting".
