# International Pressure Mounts on Israel Amid Gaza Conflict and Rising Civilian Deaths

Israel is facing increasing international pressure, especially from its main ally, the United States, to better protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza amidst escalating conflict near hospitals. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 11,000 following intense bombardment, drawing global concern over the humanitarian crisis.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his visit to India, expressed grave concerns about the civilian casualties, calling for more protection for Palestinians. However, he reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel's efforts to prevent Gaza from being a base for terrorism.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to halt bombings in Gaza and condemned Hamas's actions but acknowledged Israel's right to self-defense.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, emphasizing the threat posed by Hamas not only in Gaza but globally.

The conflict intensified with explosions and gunfire near Gaza City's hospitals, raising fears of further civilian harm. Palestinian officials accused Israel of indiscriminate bombardment, a claim echoed by the U.N. human rights chief who called for an investigation into potential breaches of international humanitarian law.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah reported seven of its fighters killed by Israeli fire, signaling heightened regional tensions.

U.S. President Biden and Secretary Blinken acknowledged some progress, including Israel's agreement to daily pauses in conflict and the establishment of humanitarian corridors. These measures aim to provide relief and assistance to affected Palestinians.

An extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Saudi Arabia is set to address the crisis, underlining the urgent need for unified action and response in the region.
