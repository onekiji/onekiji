# Hong Kong Police Raid Family Home of UK-Based Activist Nathan Law Amid Bounty Controversy

Hong Kong police have raided the family home of prominent pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK. The authorities questioned Mr Law's parents and brother regarding possible financial support for Law, but they were released without any charges. 

This action follows the recent announcement of a HK$1m (Â£99,100; US$127,800) bounty for information leading to Mr. Law's arrest. Alongside Law, seven other exiled activists are also targeted, facing charges of colluding with foreign forces. 

The countries where these activists reside, namely the UK, the US, and Australia, have no extradition treaties with China. They have condemned the actions by the Hong Kong authorities, expressing concerns over the safety of the activists and their families.
