# Fire at Crimea Military Base Triggers Large-Scale Evacuation Amid Ukraine-Russia Conflict

A fire at a military base in Crimea's Kirovske district has led to the evacuation of over 2,000 residents from four nearby settlements, according to the Moscow-backed Governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. The blaze, which occurred at a military training ground near the city of Staryi Krim, also necessitated the closure of a significant stretch of the Tavrida Highway. The cause of the fire remains unconfirmed.

Unverified reports suggest that the fire started at an ammunition depot following an alleged Ukrainian air attack. These reports, originating from Russian security-linked Telegram channels and Ukrainian media, could not be independently verified. Ukrainian authorities have yet to comment on these claims.

The fire has resulted in a series of explosions lasting several hours, with flames and smoke visible from uninhabited areas. Social media footage shows the fire ongoing for about three hours without containment.

The incident follows a recent escalation in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, including a blast damaging a bridge linking Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow attributes to Ukraine. In retaliation, Russia launched an air attack on Ukraine's port city of Odesa for the second consecutive night, targeting infrastructure and military facilities.

The situation in Crimea continues to be tense and closely monitored by the international community.
