# Massive Madrid March Protests Catalan Amnesty Law

In Madrid, an estimated 170,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the biggest protest yet against the Catalan amnesty law. The contentious law, a key condition for the formation of Spain's current Socialist government, addresses Catalonia's 2017 separatist efforts. The demonstration in Madrid, a city recently witnessing a surge in such protests, comes on the heels of Pedro SÃ¡nchez's swearing-in as Spain's Prime Minister.

Critics argue that the law undermines Spanish unity, while supporters see it as a necessary step towards reconciliation. The scale of the protest highlights the deep divisions within Spain over its approach to Catalan separatism and broader issues of national integrity.
