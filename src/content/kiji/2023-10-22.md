# Argentina's Tense Election Heads Toward Likely Run-off Amid Economic Crisis

The Argentine national election closed its polling stations yesterday, and the country braces for what appears to be an inevitable run-off. The vote took place amid Argentina's worst economic downturn in 20 years and rising public disillusionment with the traditional political elite.

The election has been a three-way race among libertarian economist Javier Milei, centrist Peronist Economy Minister Sergio Massa, and conservative Patricia Bullrich. Milei, who stunned the nation with a primary win in August, remains the frontrunner. However, sources from all three major candidates expect a run-off, given the divided electorate.

The first official results are expected to be released several hours after the polls closed at 6 p.m. local time. The election has caught the nation's attention due to its potential to reshape Argentina's political landscape and economic policies.
