# Nigeria Calls for Probe After Deadly Airstrike at Festival

In a tragic turn of events, at least 85 civilians were killed during a Muslim religious celebration in Kaduna state, northwest Nigeria, due to a military airstrike. This incident occurred on Sunday when a drone, targeting terrorists and bandits, mistakenly struck villagers at Tundun Biri.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu termed the incident a "bombing mishap" and has ordered a full-scale investigation, emphasizing the need for calm as authorities delve into the matter. The Defence Ministry described the event as a "needless tragedy", admitting that the routine mission against militants inadvertently impacted community members.

Governor Uba Sani of Kaduna State also echoed the call for an investigation into this unfortunate event. The National Emergency Management Agency reported that 85 bodies had been buried, with the search still ongoing. Over 60 individuals were hospitalized following the incident.

Lt Gen Taoreed Lagbaja, head of the army, visited the village to offer condolences. He expressed deep regret, acknowledging the error in interpreting the villagers' activities as hostile, leading to the drone strike. The Nigerian military, supported by various international allies, has been engaged in combating militants and armed criminals in northern Nigeria for years, often involving aerial assaults.

While the Air Force denied involvement in this specific operation, the incident highlights the ongoing challenges in the military's efforts to secure regions plagued by insurgency and criminal activities.
