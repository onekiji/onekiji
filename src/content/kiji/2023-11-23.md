# Dublin Rocked by Riots Following Stabbing Incident Involving Children

A knife attack outside a Dublin school has left three children and a woman injured, leading to violent protests in the city center. Buses and trams were set ablaze, and a shop was looted as demonstrators clashed with riot police. The unrest began on Thursday afternoon following the stabbing incident at Gaelscoil Chol√°iste Mhuire.

Three young children suffered injuries, with a five-year-old girl in serious condition. A woman in her 30s and a man in his 50s also sustained serious injuries. The police have detained a man in his 50s, currently being treated for injuries, and are not seeking other suspects.

The Irish Justice Minister, Helen McEntee, condemned the violence, labeling it as intolerable and manipulated by a "thuggish" element. Garda Commissioner Drew Harris attributed the disorder to a faction driven by far-right ideology. Public transport was suspended, and a cordon was set around the Irish parliament.

Authorities urged calm and warned against misinformation spreading on social media. The Irish President, Michael D Higgins, expressed sympathies for the injured and condemned the exploitation of the tragedy for malicious agendas.
