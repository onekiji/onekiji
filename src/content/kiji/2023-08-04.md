# Rahul Gandhi's Conviction Stayed by Supreme Court: A Potential Game-Changer Ahead of 2024 Elections

In a pivotal decision, India's Supreme Court stayed the defamation conviction of Rahul Gandhi, former chair of the Indian National Congress (INC). This move potentially clears the path for his return to Parliament and sets the stage for a face-off with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the upcoming 2024 general elections.

Gandhi, a key opposition figure, was previously found guilty of defamation over comments he made in 2019, leading to a two-year jail sentence, which was put on hold. The conviction had disqualified him from his parliamentary seat. Critics of the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleged political motivations behind the trial.

Justice B.R. Gavai, while commenting on the case, noted that while Gandhi's remarks might not have been in the best taste, the conviction affected not just Gandhi but also the constituents who elected him. Following the Supreme Court's decision, celebrations erupted at INC headquarters in New Delhi.

The verdict has brought relief to the INC, with party leaders asserting it as a "victory of truth". The BJP has yet to respond.
