# Nobel Peace Prize Winner Narges Mohammadiâ€”A Defiant Voice for Human Rights in Iran

Narges Mohammadi, a key figure in Iran's human rights movement, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Known for her unflinching advocacy for women's rights, Mohammadi has spent significant time in prison for her activism.

The Nobel laureate has faced multiple overlapping prison sentences, leading her family to wonder if they will ever see or speak to her again. Mohammadi's husband and twins, who are currently exiled in France, have been banned from returning to Iran.

Her activism and the consequential legal repercussions have made her a symbol of resistance against human rights abuses in Iran. This Nobel recognition amplifies her message and struggle, even as she continues to speak out from behind bars.
