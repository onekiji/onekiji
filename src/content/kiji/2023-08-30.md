# Gabon Military Seizes Power, Cancels Election Results

In a shocking turn of events, a group of military officers announced they have seized power in Gabon, nullifying the recent election results that declared President Ali Bongo the winner. The move puts an abrupt end to the Bongo family's 53-year rule over the oil-rich nation.

The officers, representing the country's defense and security forces, took to national television early Wednesday to make the announcement. They have dissolved all governmental institutions and closed the country's borders "until further notice."

The development has drawn international concern, with French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne stating that France is following the situation closely. The European Union warned that a military takeover could escalate instability in Africa. Meanwhile, French mining group Eramet has ceased all operations in Gabon due to security reasons.

This coup marks the eighth such incident in former French colonies in Africa over the past three years, most of which have occurred in the Sahel region.

The whereabouts of President Ali Bongo remain unknown, and internet access in the country has been briefly suspended. The unfolding crisis raises serious questions about governance and stability not just in Gabon, but also for its international partners.
