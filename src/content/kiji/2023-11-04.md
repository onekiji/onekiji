# Gaza Conflict Escalates Despite Global Calls for Ceasefire

In the wake of an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school shelter that claimed at least 15 lives, Arab leaders are urging US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Despite this, Blinken, alongside officials from Jordan and Egypt, has resisted, suggesting a ceasefire would enable Hamas militants to regroup.

The conflict has seen a grim toll with over 1,400 people killed and more than 240 hostages taken by Hamas in four weeks of fighting. Israel's response has included air strikes, a ground assault, and a siege on Gaza, leading to a humanitarian crisis and the displacement of over 1.5 million people.

Blinken's meeting with Middle Eastern foreign ministers in Amman highlighted a rift between the U.S. stance and its allies. While all parties agree on the need for peace, Blinken argued that a ceasefire now would benefit Hamas, referring to the group's border incursion on October 7th.

Civilian casualties have sparked worldwide protests and diplomatic responses, including Turkey recalling its ambassador to Israel. Israeli citizens have also protested, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The situation remains volatile, with Israel striking militant cells in Lebanon and fears of a new front opening. Meanwhile, the death toll includes over 3,900 Palestinian children, with more than 28 Israeli soldiers killed in the ground operation.
