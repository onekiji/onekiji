# Israel Forms Unity Government Amidst Gaza Conflict

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has joined forces with a leading political rival to form a unity government. This unprecedented move comes as Israel aims to oversee ongoing military operations in the Gaza Strip, following a recent attack by Hamas militants.

The new wartime Cabinet aims to present a united front as tensions escalate in the region. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, with reports of extensive damage due to Israeli bombardment. The only power plant in Gaza has also run out of fuel, intensifying the humanitarian crisis.

International calls for a ceasefire are growing, but both sides show no signs of backing down. The unity government is viewed as a significant political shift that may influence the conflict's trajectory.
