# Ukraine Strikes Russian Base in Crimea; Moscow Repels Drone Attack

In a significant escalation, Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency confirmed a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian military base in annexed Crimea. The strike resulted in reported casualties and disruptions, with local residents describing explosions and road closures.

Meanwhile, Russia has repelled a new drone attack on Moscow, as announced by the cityâ€™s mayor. This marks the latest in a series of drone attacks on the Russian capital, intensifying the ongoing conflict between the two nations.

Both countries' defense systems remain on high alert as tensions continue to rise. International leaders are calling for restraint, warning that further escalation could have severe consequences for the region.
