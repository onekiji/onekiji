Various nations and organizations expressed their support, viewing Zelensky's speech as a call to action against an ever-pressing issue that requires immediate global attention.

The Ukrainian President ended his address with an appeal for stronger international cooperation, stating that unity is the only way to counter the challenges posed by aggression and conflict.
