# Indian Police Raid News Outlet in Controversial Investigation

In a move that has sparked concern among media watchdogs, Indian police raided the offices and homes of journalists connected to a prominent news website. The raids are part of an ongoing investigation into alleged illegal foreign funding from China.

The news outlet in question, known for its critical stance against the current government, has been accused of receiving funds to spread "Chinese propaganda." While no arrests have been made, devices and documents were seized during the raids.

Critics argue that the investigation is an assault on press freedom in India, which has seen a decline in global press freedom rankings. Authorities defend their actions, stating that the probe is justified to assess foreign funding in media groups.

The case continues to unfold as both sides prepare for legal battles ahead.
