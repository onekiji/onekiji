# Five American Prisoners Freed in Iran After $6 Billion Deal

Five American citizens, long imprisoned in Iran on what the U.S. claims were baseless charges, are finally on their way home. The freedom of these individuals comes as part of a controversial $6 billion swap deal mediated by Qatar.

The release was triggered when $6 billion of Iranian funds, previously held in South Korean banks, reached Doha-based banks. The freed Americans include 51-year-old Siamak Namazi, who had spent nearly eight years in Iran's Evin prison, businessman Emad Shargi, 59, and 67-year-old environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British nationality.

In a reciprocal move, five Iranians imprisoned in the U.S., mainly on charges related to violating U.S. sanctions, are also being granted clemency. Not all are expected to return to Iran.

President Joe Biden welcomed the news, stating the freed Americans had endured "years of agony, uncertainty, and suffering." He also announced fresh sanctions targeting former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence for their alleged involvement in wrongful detentions.

Families of the freed prisoners expressed relief and gratitude, emphasizing the hardships their loved ones faced, including health issues and unfair trials.
