# U.S. Holds Iran Responsible for Attacks on Military Bases in Iraq and Syria

The U.S. government is ramping up pressure on Iran, accusing it of facilitating recent attacks on American military bases in Iraq and Syria. Both the White House and the Pentagon have issued strong statements this week.

White House spokesperson John Kirby warned that Iran is "actively facilitating" rocket and drone strikes carried out by Iranian-backed militias. President Biden has instructed the Department of Defense to brace for additional attacks and to respond appropriately.

Similarly, the Pentagon has vowed to hold Iran accountable for the ongoing assaults on U.S. troops, signaling a heightened stance against Tehran.

The development follows an uptick in attacks targeting American forces in the region, although no further details on the U.S. response have been disclosed.

Experts warn that this escalation could lead to increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with potential implications for stability in the Middle East.
