# Chinese County Offers Cash Incentive for Young Brides

In an unconventional move to boost marriage rates, a county in eastern China is offering a cash "reward" of 1,000 yuan ($137) to couples where the bride is aged 25 or younger. This initiative is the latest in a series of measures aimed at encouraging young people to tie the knot, as concerns over China's declining birth rate continue to escalate.

Authorities believe that incentivizing marriage among younger couples could be a step toward reversing the declining trend in the country's population growth. However, the policy has received mixed reactions, with some critics questioning its effectiveness and ethical implications.

The county's initiative adds to a growing list of efforts by Chinese officials to combat a shrinking population, which poses economic and social challenges for the nation.
