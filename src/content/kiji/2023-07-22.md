# Russia faces international criticism over grain deal withdrawal and attacks on Ukrainian ports

Russia has been heavily criticized globally for its decision to withdraw from the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative and for its strikes on Ukrainian ports. The move has caused grain prices to surge, impacting food security and potentially causing starvation in the world's poorest countries.

Despite the UN's efforts to facilitate the export of Russian fertilizer, Russia suspended its participation in the agreement and has demanded better global access for its own agricultural products. Russia's withdrawal from the deal, coupled with its announcement that it would consider all ships en route to Ukrainian Black Sea ports as involved in the conflict, has effectively reimposed Russia's blockade.

The Ukrainian grain deal, brokered last year, had restarted shipments of Ukrainian grain after a Russian blockade had caused global food prices to skyrocket. The deal had resulted in a drop in food prices by more than 23% since March 2022. However, Russia argues that only 3% of the grain went to the lowest-income nations.

The decision to withdraw from the deal has drawn criticism from many countries, including China, Egypt, and several African members of the UN Security Council. The UN has pledged to continue its efforts to persuade Russia to return to the initiative and to ensure grain and fertilizer from Ukraine and Russia can reach global markets.

In recent developments, Russian forces have been attacking Ukrainian ports and agricultural facilities along the Black Sea, leading to concerns over further disruptions to food security. The UN has warned that any attacks against civilian infrastructure could constitute war crimes.
