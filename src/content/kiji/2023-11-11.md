# Israel Orders Evacuation of Gaza Hospitals Amid Military Campaign

In a significant escalation of tensions, Israel's military has initiated a campaign demanding the evacuation of hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip. This action is part of a strategy to target Hamas militants, who are believed to be using these medical facilities for cover.

Palestinian sources report that these hospitals, already struggling under the weight of numerous patients, are functioning minimally, if at all. Some have even suspended services. The Israeli military insists that the evacuation is crucial to effectively pursue and neutralize the Hamas militants.

This development has raised international concerns about the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. The already fragile healthcare infrastructure is on the brink of collapse, with vital medical services being disrupted. Human rights organizations and international observers are calling for immediate cessation of hostilities and protection of civilian infrastructure, particularly medical facilities, which are lifelines for the embattled population.

The situation remains tense, with no immediate resolution in sight, as the international community watches closely.
