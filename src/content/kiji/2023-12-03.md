# US Warship Responds to Houthi Attacks in Red Sea

In a significant escalation of maritime tensions, a US warship, the USS Carney, and commercial vessels faced drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea, reportedly launched by Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels. The Pentagon, confirming awareness of the attacks, stated that the USS Carney and commercial ships were targeted but did not report any casualties or damage to the warship.

The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting they targeted two ships, Unity Explorer and Number 9, with a drone and a naval missile. The rebels accused these ships of being Israeli, a claim denied by Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. Maritime Traffic records show that Unity Explorer is flagged in the Bahamas, and Number 9 in Panama.

This incident marks a continuation of the Houthis' aggression in the region, including several attacks on Israel and increased targeting of commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Notably, the Red Sea is a strategic naval route south of the Suez Canal, vital for maritime traffic between Europe, Asia, and East Africa.

Previously, the Houthis had captured the Galaxy Leader, a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship, and attempted to seize the Central Park, a tanker, which led to a US warship intercepting the attackers.

The maritime security situation in the Red Sea remains tense, with Britain's Maritime Trade Operations agency urging caution in the area following reports of a drone attack in the Bab el-Mandab strait.

The US military's engagement in the region reflects the heightened risks in the Mideast maritime domain, linked to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the broader regional conflict.
