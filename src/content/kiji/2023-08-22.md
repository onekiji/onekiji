# Fukushima Wastewater Release Scheduled for Aug. 24 Amidst Controversies

Japan has announced its plan to release treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean starting Aug. 24. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) will discharge approximately 1.3 million cubic meters of water over the next 30 years. This move follows a two-year review by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that found the release would pose minimal risks to humans and the environment.

The decision has faced criticism both domestically and internationally. China and some other nations have voiced concerns over the plan's safety. Local fishing groups in Japan are worried about potential impacts on seafood sales, and threats of consumer boycotts have been made against Japanese brands.

A major concern revolves around the radioactive isotope, tritium, which cannot be removed from the wastewater. However, authorities state that the water will be highly diluted and released over decades, ensuring that tritium concentrations remain within international safety limits. Despite assurances, the plan has sparked debates among experts on the potential long-term biological effects of tritium exposure.

The IAEA and other third parties will oversee the release to ensure safety.
