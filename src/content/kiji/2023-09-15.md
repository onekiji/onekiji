# U.S. Sanctions and Iranian Activist Highlight Ongoing Struggle for Democracy in Iran

In a series of unfolding events tied to the one-year anniversary of activist Mahsa Amini's death, both internal and external pressures are spotlighting Iran's human rights issues.

Majid Tavakoli, a prominent Iranian political activist, has warned against the rising totalitarian regime in Iran. Tavakoli, who is preparing to serve a six-year jail term, emphasized that the majority of Iranians yearn for a liberal democratic system. His warning comes as protests continue to shake Iran, a year after Mahsa Aminiâ€™s tragic death in similar demonstrations.

Simultaneously, the Biden administration has imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting more than two dozen individuals and entities involved in suppressing protests. This move marks the latest U.S. effort to hold Tehran accountable for human rights abuses.

Both developments signify an escalating concern for civil liberties in Iran and indicate that the struggle for democracy is far from over.
