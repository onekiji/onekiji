# Israeli Minister Sidelined After Nuclear Strike Comment on Gaza

In a swift response to a controversial statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suspended Heritage Minister Amihay Eliyahu for suggesting that a nuclear strike on Gaza could be a viable option. Eliyahu's comment, made during a radio interview, has sparked outrage across the Arab world and drawn criticism from U.S. officials, who labeled the remark as "objectionable."

As the conflict with Hamas escalates, causing increasing Palestinian civilian casualties, such remarks have added to the tension. The Heritage Minister, part of a far-right party within the coalition government, has been barred from cabinet meetings until further notice.

The international community and Israeli broadcasters have condemned the statement, which strays far from official Israeli policy and the country's stance on nuclear ambiguity. Eliyahu, along with his party leader, does not participate in the ministerial forum overseeing the Gaza conflict, nor do they possess authority over military decisions. This incident highlights the challenges Netanyahu faces in managing a coalition with diverse and sometimes extreme viewpoints.
