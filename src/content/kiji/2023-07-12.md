# G7 Set to Ratify Comprehensive Security Pact with Ukraine; No NATO Entry Date Provided

The G7 members are expected to confirm a sweeping security agreement with Ukraine on the sidelines of a NATO summit, focusing on defence equipment, training, and intelligence sharing. However, the coalition did not provide a clear timeline for Ukraine's NATO entry, drawing the ire of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Despite NATO's promise that Ukraine could join once conditions are met, Zelensky criticized the lack of an explicit timeframe as "absurd." The proposed security pact, led by the UK and including partners like the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, aims to shield Ukraine against potential future Russian aggressions.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suggested this pact would send a "strong signal" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. US President Joe Biden also proposed a model akin to Washington's agreement with Israel, entailing significant military aid but not a commitment to assist during an attack.

NATO is also preparing for the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, providing a platform for tighter cooperation. Additionally, Ukraine is set to receive training for US-made F-16 fighter jets and more than 70 UK-delivered combat and logistics vehicles.

Critics, however, warn that Ukraine's almost automatic NATO membership could incentivize Russia to escalate the ongoing conflict.
