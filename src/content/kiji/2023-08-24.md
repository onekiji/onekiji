# Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner Group Leader, Dies in Russian Plane Crash

Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia's powerful Wagner mercenary group, was confirmed to be among the passengers of a plane that crashed north of Moscow on Wednesday evening. The incident left no survivors. Prigozhin had recently led a failed mutiny against the Russian army's top officials.

The Wagner Group's Telegram channel, Grey Zone, declared him dead, branding him a "hero" and "patriot." The channel suggested he died at the hands of "traitors to Russia."

The crash site revealed fragments of the plane scattered near a wooded area. Forensic teams were on the scene, while mourners paid their respects at Wagner's offices in St. Petersburg.

Speculation surrounds the cause of the crash. Some attribute it to the Russian state, while others point towards Ukraine. The incident coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day. Prigozhin's death is viewed by many as eliminating a significant challenger to President Vladimir Putin's authority.

The Russian Federal Aviation Agency Rosaviatsiya was quick to confirm Prigozhin's presence on the flight, raising eyebrows due to the swiftness of their statement. Meanwhile, Russian state media has kept coverage of the incident minimal.

The event has sparked debates on its implications for future dissenters against the Kremlin's leadership.
