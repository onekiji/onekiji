# Paris Bans Rental E-Scooters After Public Vote

The City of Lights has dimmed the prospects of rental e-scooters on its streets. Effective from Friday, Paris has become the first European capital to ban rented electric scooters. The landmark decision follows a referendum earlier this year in which an overwhelming 89% of Parisians voted to remove the two-wheelers, albeit on a modest 7.5% voter turnout.

Initiated in 2018, the e-scooter program witnessed immense popularity but was marred by safety concerns and public nuisance. Paris recorded 459 accidents involving e-scooters in 2022, three of them fatal. Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who had backed the ban, expressed her intent to "calm down" the city streets.

The move ends a five-year experiment and leads to the redistribution of nearly 15,000 e-scooters to other European cities, including Lille, London, and Copenhagen. Deputy Mayor David Belliard emphasized that the ban aligns with broader efforts to "simplify, calm down, and de-clutter" public spaces in Paris.

While some users mourn the loss, city officials believe the ample public transport and expanding bike lanes will serve as adequate alternatives. The decision sets a precedent that other cities are likely to watch closely as they grapple with the balance between urban mobility and public safety.
