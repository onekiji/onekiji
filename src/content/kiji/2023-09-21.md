# India Suspends Visas for Canadians Amid Diplomatic Tensions

India has halted visa services for Canadian citizens, citing "security threats" faced by its diplomats in Canada. This move comes in the wake of accusations from Ottawa implying New Delhi's involvement in the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in Canada.

BLS International, the agency overseeing Indian visa applications in Canada, confirmed the suspension and indicated the decision was effective from 21 September 2023. India's Ministry of External Affairs explained that the suspension was a response to "incitement of violence" and perceived inaction by Canadian authorities, which disrupted the operations of Indian diplomatic missions in Canada.

In a recent development, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mentioned that Canadian intelligence is investigating the possible involvement of "agents of the government of India" in Nijjar's killing. In response, India criticized Canada for trying to divert attention from Khalistani extremists sheltered in the country. Trudeau emphasized the seriousness of the allegations and called for India's cooperation in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Indian foreign ministry stated they are awaiting specific information on the case from Canada.

The Khalistan movement, which reached its zenith in the 1980s, seeks a separate Sikh homeland. While its influence has waned in India, it still garners support among some Sikhs abroad, especially in countries like Canada.
