# India's Moon Rover Completes Historic Mission, Now in Sleep Mode

India's moon rover, Pragyan, from the Chandrayaan-3 mission has successfully completed its historic walk on the lunar surface, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The rover was put into 
"sleep mode" less than two weeks after its groundbreaking landing near the lunar south pole.

Pragyan traveled over 100 meters and sent valuable data back to Earth, including evidence of sulfur, iron, oxygen, and several other elements. Scientists are particularly keen to analyze this data for signs of 
frozen water, which could be crucial for future astronaut missions.

"Pragyan completes its assignments. It is now safely parked and set into sleep mode," ISRO announced late Saturday. The agency added that the batteries are fully charged, and the receiver is on, leaving the 
possibility of a "successful awakening for another set of assignments."

India joins the elite club of nations, including the United States, China, and the former Soviet Union, to have landed a rover on the moon. Moreover, India set itself apart by successfully reaching the rugged 
lunar south pole, shortly after Russia's Luna-25 mission failed in a similar attempt.

ISRO is already looking forward to its next mission—a probe to study solar winds—while the data from Pragyan continues to be analyzed.
