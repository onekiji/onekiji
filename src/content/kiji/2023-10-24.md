# Israeli Hostage, Yocheved Lifshitz, Released by Hamas Speaks Out

In a surprising turn of events, Yocheved Lifshitz, one of two elderly hostages released by Hamas on Monday, spoke to journalists about her experience. Lifshitz stated that she "went through hell" and was physically assaulted on the day she was captured. Despite the ordeal, she shook the hand of a Hamas militant upon her release, citing that she was treated well during her captivity.

Lifshitz's release has stirred a mixed response from the international community and raised questions about the ethics of her handshake. While some see it as an act of humanizing an enemy, others argue that it trivializes the gravity of the situation.

Further details about the other released hostage and the conditions of their release are still pending. The incident has rekindled debates on hostage negotiations and the complexities involved in such high-stake situations.
