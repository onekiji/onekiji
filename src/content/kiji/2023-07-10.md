# Spain's High Court Pauses Pegasus Spyware Probe Due to Lack of Israeli Cooperation

Spain's High Court has temporarily halted an investigation into alleged spying activities involving Israeli firm NSO Group's Pegasus software against Spanish politicians, due to lack of cooperation from Israeli authorities. Judge Jose Luis Calama, who led the probe, stated that the silence from Israel indicates a "complete lack of legal cooperation", forcing him to archive the case until further developments occur.

The Pegasus spyware was allegedly used to hack the phones of top Spanish officials including Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Defence Minister Margarita Robles, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and Agriculture Minister Luis Planas between October 2020 and December 2021. It led to a political crisis in Spain last year and the subsequent resignation of the country's spy chief. 

Calama had previously issued formal requests to the Israeli government for details on the NSO Group's software and to take a statement from the company's CEO, but received no response. He suggests that only a diplomatic push by the Spanish government could help advance the case now.
