# Belarus Accused of Airspace Violation, Poland Bolsters Border Security

Poland is augmenting its eastern border security after accusations of two Belarusian helicopters violating its airspace on Tuesday. The alleged violation was dismissed as "far-fetched" by Belarus. The incident took place in the Bialowieza area, where Belarus had intended to conduct training exercises.

In response to the incident, Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Belarus's charge d'affaires for an immediate explanation and issued a protest. Poland views the incident as an escalation of tension along the Polish-Belarusian border and urges Belarus to refrain from such actions.

The incident has stoked concerns among Poland and its NATO allies regarding potential threats from Belarus, a Russian ally. It follows reports of the presence of a contingent of the Wagner mercenary group in Belarus, which fled there following an attempted coup against the Kremlin in June.

Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has warned of the group potentially assisting migrants to cross into Poland, exacerbating the ongoing migrant crisis. Both Poland and Lithuania, EU and NATO members, have been grappling with a significant influx of migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa.

Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has been accused of intentionally attracting migrants to release them into the EU, a claim he denies.
