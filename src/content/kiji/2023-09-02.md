# Nobel Foundation Rescinds Invites to Russia, Belarus, and Iran for Stockholm Ceremony

The Nobel Foundation, amidst strong reactions in Sweden, has withdrawn its invitation to Russia, Belarus, and Iran for this year's Nobel Prize awards ceremony in Stockholm. The decision follows last year's exclusion of Russia and Belarus due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Iran's human rights issues.

The foundation had previously defended its decision, emphasizing the importance of conveying the Nobel Prize's values broadly. However, the public's response overshadowed this intent.

Sweden's Prime Minister, Ulf Kristersson, welcomed the reversal, and Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraineâ€™s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, praised the decision as a "restoration of justice."

In related news, Nobel committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen condemned Russia's decision to classify Nobel Peace Prize-winning journalist Dmitry Muratov as a "foreign agent", calling the move politically motivated.
