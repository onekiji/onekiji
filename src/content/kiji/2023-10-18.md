# Biden Pledges Support for Israel and Gaza Amid Hospital Blast Controversy

During a crucial visit to Tel Aviv, President Joe Biden pledged support for both Israel and the Palestinians, further complicating an already volatile situation in the Middle East. Biden attributed a recent devastating explosion at a Christian-run hospital in Gaza City to an "errant rocket" fired by a militant group in Gaza. The blast is estimated to have resulted in hundreds of casualties.

The President announced $100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian aid in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. He stated that the U.S. stands "unequivocally for the protection of civilian life" in conflict zones, but his comments have stirred controversy, given differing accounts of the event. While Israeli officials back Biden's claim about the cause of the explosion, Palestinian health officials and Hamas contend it was due to an Israeli airstrike.

As the Middle East witnesses escalating tensions and protests, Biden's statements could either pave the way for diplomatic talks or fuel further unrest. The President is expected to continue discussions with Palestinian and Egyptian leaders as he navigates this complex and sensitive issue.
