# US to Supply Controversial Cluster Munitions to Ukraine Amid NATO Membership Talks

The US has decided to supply Ukraine with widely banned cluster munitions for its counteroffensive against Russian forces. This controversial move, part of an $800 million security package, is a part of Washington's efforts to support Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. These cluster munitions, prohibited by over 100 countries, are known for their wide area effect and post-conflict danger posed by unexploded bomblets. Despite criticism from rights groups and the UN, the US has said that Ukraine has assured the munitions will be used carefully to minimize civilian risk.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is visiting NATO countries, seeking support for Ukraine's potential membership. While NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg affirms that Ukraine will become a member, not all member nations agree due to potential risks of escalating the conflict with Russia. The discussion will continue at the NATO summit next week. President Joe Biden has expressed uncertainty over the unanimity of NATO regarding Ukraine's membership.

In other news, the UN warns Russia to adhere to the safe wartime passage of agricultural exports agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative. If not extended beyond its July 17 expiration, Western states may cease cooperating with UN officials helping Moscow with its exports.
