# African Leaders Express Concern Over Russian Grain Blockade at Russia-Africa Summit

A significant drop in the number of African leaders attending this year's Russia-Africa Summit in St. Petersburg reflects the continent's growing frustration with Russia's stance on the global stage. The key issue is Russia's suspension of a grain deal that facilitated the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. This suspension is exacerbating food insecurity in Africa. Many speculate that Russia is leveraging the grain crisis to regain access to SWIFT, the global banking system.

African Union Chairman Azali Assoumani expressed the continent's concern during the summit, urging Russia to facilitate access to both Ukrainian and Russian grain. He emphasized the grave implications of the grain blockade on food prices and the dire food security situation in Africa. Despite Russia's promises to supply free grain to certain African countries, Assoumani stressed that the suspension of the grain deal could negatively impact Russia's cooperation with Africa.

Moreover, Russia's increasing militaristic presence in Africa, particularly through the Wagner Group's activities in several African countries, is raising concerns about the future of security partnerships. The Russia-Africa summit is seen as an opportunity for clarity on these partnerships.

Meanwhile, Russia continues to use anti-colonial rhetoric to stir up tensions between Western countries and Africa, a tactic that some African leaders find appealing due to perceived Western hypocrisy and bullying.
