# ECOWAS Meeting on Niger Coup Postponed Amid Rising Concerns for Detained President

An emergency meeting of the Economic Cooperation of West African Nations (ECOWAS) on the recent coup in Niger has been indefinitely postponed. This decision comes amid escalating concerns over the health of detained President Mohammed Bazoum.

ECOWAS had convened in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, initially to discuss potential military intervention measures in Niger, emphasizing that any action would be a police operation and not a war against the nation. However, the meeting was suspended due to unspecified "technical reasons."

Following the sixth military takeover in West Africa in three years, ECOWAS has taken stringent measures, including severing financial ties, halting electricity supplies, and closing borders with Niger.

The coup leaders, solidifying their stance, have already announced a 21-member cabinet. Meanwhile, demonstrations in Niger's capital, Niamey, have highlighted growing support for the coup and a shift towards Russian influence. This trend has raised alarms among Western powers, drawing comparisons to Mali and Burkina Faso's recent political shifts.

International entities, including the African Union, European Union, United States, and United Nations, have voiced their apprehensions about President Bazoum's detention, urging for a peaceful resolution and the restoration of democratic order.
