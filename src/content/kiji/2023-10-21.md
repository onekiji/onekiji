# 100,000 March in London for Palestinian Solidarity Amid Global Protests

Approximately 100,000 individuals took to the streets of central London on Saturday, in a "National March for Palestine" to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The march follows a recent attack on Israel by Hamas and was organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

Protesters chanting "Free Palestine" gathered near Downing Street, the residence of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The demonstration was largely peaceful, with police making 10 arrests. Authorities had previously warned against expressions of support for Hamas, which is banned in the UK as a terrorist organization.

The protest comes amid heightened tensions and a spike in hate crimes. Recent figures indicate a 1,353% increase in antisemitic offences and a 140% rise in Islamophobic incidents this month, compared to the same period last year. Speakers at the march defended the slogan "Free Palestine" against accusations of antisemitism, describing it as a call for a homeland for the Palestinian people.

The demonstration in London is part of a larger global movement, with rallies also held in Australia and Italy.
