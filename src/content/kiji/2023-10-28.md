# Israel Escalates Gaza Conflict, Netanyahu Warns of ‘Long and Difficult’ Stage Ahead

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday that the conflict in Gaza has escalated to a new stage, involving ground forces and expanded operations from the air and sea. The latest phase aims to destroy Hamas' military and governmental capabilities and to secure the release of hostages taken during an October 7 Hamas attack.

Netanyahu warned the nation in a televised news conference that this stage of the conflict will be "long and difficult." The announcement has led to increased domestic pressure on the Israeli government to prioritize the safe return of hostages. Family members of the hostages have met with Netanyahu, expressing support for a possible exchange involving Palestinian prisoners.

The situation has sparked protests in central Tel Aviv, where demonstrators are demanding a ceasefire and the safe return of the hostages. Among those voicing concern are family members of hostages, who are increasingly worried as Israel intensifies its bombardment of Gaza.

Amid the escalated conflict, the Israeli military has released images of tank columns moving into open areas in Gaza and said that warplanes have bombed dozens of Hamas tunnels and bunkers. Communications in Gaza have been largely cut off, leaving its 2.3 million residents isolated from the world.

Netanyahu reiterated that Israel is determined to bring back all hostages and destroy Hamas' capabilities, despite growing concerns and protests.
