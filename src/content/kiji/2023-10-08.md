# Over 2,400 Dead in Afghan Earthquakes

Two devastating earthquakes hit Afghanistan on Saturday, resulting in more than 2,400 deaths. The quakes struck near the city of Herat and are considered the deadliest in years.

According to the Taliban administration and the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquakes occurred 35 km (20 miles) northwest of the city of Herat. The tremors had magnitudes of 6.3 and 5.8, making them among the most severe to impact the quake-prone mountainous country in recent history.

The natural disaster has prompted international concern and calls for immediate humanitarian aid. Recovery efforts are ongoing, but the full extent of the damage is yet to be assessed.
