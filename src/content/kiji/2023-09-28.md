# Three Dead in Twin Rotterdam Shootings; Gunman Arrested

A 32-year-old male gunman killed at least three people in twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday, Dutch police reported. The assailant, identified as a student at Erasmus University, first opened fire in a residential home, leaving a 39-year-old woman and her 14-year-old daughter dead. The house was subsequently set ablaze. The gunman then attacked Erasmus Medical Center, fatally shooting a 43-year-old male lecturer.

Security footage revealed the attacker, dressed in camouflage, being escorted from the hospital in handcuffs. The motive for the shootings remains unclear. An unnamed security guard who was first on the scene described the events as "shocking" and "terrible."
