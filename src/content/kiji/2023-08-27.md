# Mnangagwa Secures Second Term as Zimbabwe's President Amid Controversy

Zimbabwe's incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been reelected, overcoming a tightly contested race that experienced delays. According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, Mnangagwa garnered 52.6% of the vote, edging out Nelson Chamisa of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), who received 44%.

The win solidifies the Zanu-PF party's decades-long dominance in Zimbabwean politics, a trend uninterrupted since the country's independence in 1980. The election outcome has stirred controversy, with Chamisa rejecting the official results.
