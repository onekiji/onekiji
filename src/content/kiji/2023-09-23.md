# U.S. Weighs in on Canada-India Diplomatic Tension Over Sikh Activist's Death

The U.S. has expressed deep concern over the growing diplomatic strain between Canada and India. This follows allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing India of involvement in the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver earlier this year. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged India to collaborate with Canada on the investigation.

The U.S. ambassador to Canada, David Cohen, revealed that intelligence from the 'Five Eyes' alliance supported Canada's claims. However, India has vehemently denied any involvement, leading to both nations expelling senior diplomats and issuing travel advisories against each other.

Canada has yet to present public evidence supporting Trudeau's claims. The situation remains tense as investigations continue.
