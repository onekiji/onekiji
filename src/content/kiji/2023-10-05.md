# Outrage Erupts Over Iranian Teen Hospitalized After Alleged Morality Police Assault

Public outcry is mounting in Iran and globally following the hospitalization of 16-year-old Armita Geravand. Armita is said to have suffered a "severe physical assault" by government agents enforcing Iran's strict Islamic dress code. The incident has reignited criticisms of the morality police, especially as it comes on the heels of similar cases that led to mass protests last year.

State-run media have countered these claims, stating that Armita fainted due to a drop in blood pressure and denying allegations of physical assault. However, they have not released full security footage of the incident, leaving key questions unanswered.

International attention is growing, with officials such as German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and US Deputy Special Envoy for Iran, Abram Paley, expressing concern and condemnation. Iranian authorities have dismissed the global outcry as "insincere concern."

The event has triggered calls for greater transparency and scrutiny of Iran's morality police, whose actions have been increasingly questioned both domestically and internationally.
