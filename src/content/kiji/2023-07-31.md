# 54 Dead in Pakistan Suicide Bombing at Political Gathering, Investigation Underway

A devastating suicide bombing at a political convention in northwestern Pakistan on Sunday has claimed at least 54 lives and left more than 100 injured. The gathering was organized by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) party in the town of Khar, Bajaur district, close to the Afghanistan border.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but local authorities speculate that the regional branch of ISIS could be involved, given their history of targeting JUI-F party leaders. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has strongly condemned the attack and initiated an investigation involving the Interior Minister and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.

The leader of the JUI-F party, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, expressed deep sorrow following the attack and called for the best possible treatment for the injured. This tragedy comes as political parties begin campaign preparations for elections due later this year.

Victims of the bombing were buried on Monday, while the critically injured were transported to Peshawar for treatment. Statements from the wounded have been recorded as part of the ongoing investigation. The bombing has drawn nationwide condemnation, with condolences pouring in from across the country and beyond, including from the U.S. and Russian embassies in Islamabad.
