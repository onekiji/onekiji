# UAE Faces Criticism for Alleged Oil Promotion Plans at Cop28 Climate Summit

The United Arab Emirates, host of the UN Cop28 summit, is under scrutiny after leaked documents suggest plans to promote oil and gas deals during climate talks. Sultan Al Jaber, Cop28 president and CEO of UAE's national oil company Adnoc, is at the center of this controversy. Critics view his dual role as a conflict of interest, potentially undermining the summit's credibility.

Reports by The Guardian and the Centre for Climate Reporting reveal briefing documents prepared for Al Jaber's meetings with 27 governments, which include "talking points" from Adnoc. These points propose collaboration in oil and gas projects, contradicting global climate goals.

For instance, Adnoc expressed interest in exploring LNG opportunities in Mozambique, Canada, and Australia with China, and assisting Colombia in developing its oil reserves. These proposals defy climate scientists' warnings against new fossil fuel projects to maintain safe global temperatures.

Responses from nations vary, with some denying discussions on deals, while others did not comment. The UAE's Cop28 team, however, insists on their independence from Adnoc and Masdar, another UAE energy company, emphasizing a focus on ambitious climate outcomes.

The controversy raises questions about the UAE's commitment to climate action, as it holds the critical role of leading the Cop28 summit, scheduled to conclude on December 12. The outcome of the summit and UAE's leadership will be closely watched for their impact on global climate initiatives.
