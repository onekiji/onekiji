# Russia Intensifies Attacks in Ukraine Amidst International Support for Ukraine

Rising tensions marked the conflict in Ukraine on July 1, as reports of continued Russian aggression and Ukrainian resilience surfaced. Russia killed at least 30 Ukrainian soldiers with missile strikes and eliminated a Ukrainian foothold along the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine, according to a Russian-appointed leader. Meanwhile, a Russian missile hit a school in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, killing two civilians and wounding six others.

In an unsettling turn, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned of a "serious threat" at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. He stated that Russia is "technically ready" to provoke a localized explosion at the facility, based on intelligence from Ukrainian military, though Russia's U.N. ambassador dismissed these allegations.

Despite the escalating violence, Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv suffered a drone strike early Monday morning, marking the first such attack in 12 days. The swarm of Russian drones were packed with deadly explosives, further elevating the tensions in the region.

As the conflict intensifies, international support for Ukraine grows. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, during his visit to Ukraine, voiced support for the creation of a Ukraine-NATO Defense Council. The council, expected to be announced at the upcoming NATO summit in Lithuania, would provide more aid to Ukraine and allow quicker updates from the battlefield. Spain also pledged a 55 million euro ($60 million) financial package to Ukraine.
