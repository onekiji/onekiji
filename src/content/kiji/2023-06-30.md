# France Engulfed in Riots Following Police Shooting of Teenager

Unrest continues to sweep across France following the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Nahel M., a teenager of Algerian and Moroccan descent. This marks the third night of riots that have spread to major cities throughout the nation, including Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Pau, Toulouse, and Lille.

Nahel M. was shot dead during a traffic stop in Nanterre, a working-class suburb of Paris. Protesters in the area have torched cars, barricaded streets, and hurled projectiles at police following a peaceful vigil for the teen.

The incident occurred during Tuesday's morning rush hour when Nahel failed to stop after being spotted driving in a bus lane. A police officer fired a lethal shot at close range through the driver's window as the teen attempted to evade capture, resulting in his death.

The officer has been charged with voluntary homicide and is currently held in preventive detention. His lawyer claims that the officer did not intend to kill Nahel and asked for the victim's family to forgive him.

The shooting has fueled longstanding complaints of police violence and systemic racism within French law enforcement. President Emmanuel Macron condemned the shooting as "unforgivable" and has also denounced the ongoing unrest.

Thousands took to the streets in Nanterre to march in memory of Nahel. The teen's mother, who wore a white T-shirt reading "Justice for Nahel" and the date of his death, addressed the crowd: "I have something against one person, he who killed my son. He did not have to kill my son," she said.

The current upheaval revives memories of the 2005 riots that forced then-president Jacques Chirac to declare a state of emergency. That wave of violence was sparked by the death of two young people who were electrocuted in a power substation while hiding from police.

This is the third fatal shooting during a traffic stop in France in 2023, down from a record 13 last year. The majority of victims since 2017 have been Black or of Arab origin, underscoring the racial tensions that continue to simmer in the country.

As the situation continues to escalate, with protesters setting up barricades, burning cars, and ransacking banks, the French government has deployed 40,000 police officers across the country in an attempt to restore order.

As the crisis mounts, it remains to be seen how President Macron and his administration will respond to the growing calls for police reform and racial justice.
