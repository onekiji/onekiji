# Elon Musk Declines Ukrainian Request to Use Starlink for Military Operation; Faces Criticism and Support

Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, recently revealed he turned down a request from Ukraine to use the Starlink satellite network in a planned attack on Russian ships anchored in Crimea's Sevastopol. Musk stated he couldn't be complicit in a "major act of war" and feared potential nuclear retaliation from Russia.

The decision drew a mixed response. A senior Ukrainian official accused Musk of "committing evil" for denying their plea, arguing that Russia's Black Sea Fleet has been involved in a de facto blockade of Ukrainian ports. The official also criticized Musk for sharing confidential exchanges about military use of Starlink without permission.

Musk defended his choice, citing conversations with senior Russian officials that led him to believe Russia would respond with nuclear weapons to a Ukrainian attack. The revelation came from an excerpt of a soon-to-be-released biography on Musk, stirring further debates on social media.

The situation also raises questions about the ethical responsibilities of tech companies in global conflicts. Musk initially agreed to supply Starlink hardware to Ukraine but reportedly had second thoughts after Ukraine successfully repelled an initial Russian invasion.

The episode has added another layer to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the role of private companies in matters of international security.
