# Southern Europe Suffers as Wildfires Continue Amid Severe Heatwave

Greek wildfires have been reignited due to rising temperatures and strong winds, leading to a fresh wave of evacuations. A recent surge in temperature across southern Europe has exacerbated the situation, with firefighting teams from Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Italy, France, and Israel being deployed to aid Greece's local emergency services.

The wildfires have been partly driven by the intense summer weather, with temperatures in southern Greece expected to reach 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). The heatwave, expected to last until Sunday, has also led to the closure of several historical sites, including the Acropolis. 

In addition to Greece, many regions in southern Europe are facing extreme heat, with forecasters predicting more scorching weather. Italy, Spain, and the south of France have recorded temperatures up to 46 degrees Celsius. 

The EU's climate observatory warns that the world is likely heading for its warmest July on record, with climate scientists attributing the increasing frequency and severity of these heatwaves to human-induced global warming. The Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has urged for "absolute vigilance and absolute readiness" in the coming days as the new heatwave moves east across the country.
