# Nagorno-Karabakh Crisis Highlights Russia's Waning Influence

Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave, has recently witnessed Turkish-backed Azerbaijani forces taking control, raising concerns about Russia's influence in the region. This turn of events has reminded many of the scenes at Kabul airport when U.S. forces exited Afghanistan. The crisis has led to hundreds of deaths, with over 100,000 ethnic Armenians now facing the difficult choice of leaving their historical homeland or integrating into Azerbaijan.

Russia's handling of the situation has drawn criticism, leading to strained relations with Armenia and prompting Moscow to defend its foreign policy stance. Despite the challenges, Russia remains committed to its presence in the South Caucasus, a key region with numerous oil and gas pipelines.

The situation emphasizes the intricate balance of power in the area, with Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iran pressuring Russia's traditional sphere of influence. As discussions begin to address the current unrest, the primary responsibility lies with Aliyev, Azerbaijan's leader, and Russia's peacekeepers. Observers suggest that a more robust international response, possibly involving both U.S. and Russian troops, might be necessary to ensure stability and prevent further ethnic conflict.

The world now watches closely, hoping for a peaceful and humane resolution to a conflict that has endured for decades.
