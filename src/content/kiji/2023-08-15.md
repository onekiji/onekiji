# Three Bulgarians Arrested in UK on Suspicion of Spying for Russia

British police have arrested three Bulgarian nationals on charges of possessing fake identity documents amid allegations of spying for Russia. The individuals, identified as Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzambazov, and Katrin Ivanova, were detained in February as part of a significant national security investigation. They were later charged under the Official Secrets Act and have been remanded in custody.

The suspects have been living in the UK for several years and have had various professional backgrounds. The documents they were found with cover multiple countries including the UK, Bulgaria, and several other European nations. Despite these serious allegations, the police have not officially confirmed if they are suspected Russian spies.

This development comes as Britain intensifies its focus on external security threats, recently passing a new national security law aimed at deterring espionage and foreign interference. With tensions between the UK and Russia remaining high, the UK government has labelled Russia as "the most acute threat" to its security.
