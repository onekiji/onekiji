# Niger Coup Update: Deposed President Bazoum Faces "High Treason" Charges

Niger's military junta announced their intent to prosecute ousted President Mohamed Bazoum for "high treason," a charge that could lead to the death penalty under the country's laws. The regime alleges it has gathered evidence against Bazoum and his associates, both local and foreign.

This development comes in the wake of the coup that saw Bazoum ousted by the presidential guard, causing political chaos and drawing international criticism. Niger, once a beacon of democracy in the Sahel region, now adds to West Africa's growing instability.

Bazoum has made allegations of maltreatment, claiming he's been deprived of human contact and essential supplies. These claims have been refuted by the junta, who stated the former president received recent medical attention without any issues reported.

The situation has garnered a regional response. ECOWAS has enacted sanctions against Niger and issued a stern ultimatum to the military leaders: restore constitutional order or face potential military intervention. However, the broader West African context remains tense, with nations like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea expressing solidarity with Niger's junta, hinting at a potential regional crisis.

With mounting pressures and the ever-evolving situation, West Africa watches closely as events in Niger unfold.
