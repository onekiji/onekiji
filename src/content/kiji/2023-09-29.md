# Europe's Ancient Footwear: 6,000-Year-Old Sandals Discovered in Spain

Researchers from the Autonomous University of Barcelona and Alcal√° University have uncovered what are believed to be the oldest shoes in Europe. The discovery was made in a Spanish cave and features 22 woven sandals dating back 6,000 years, according to radiocarbon analysis. The findings were recently published in the journal Science Advances.

These ancient sandals were remarkably well-preserved, thanks to the cave's low humidity and cool winds. Originally plundered by 19th-century miners, the cave also contained other Mesolithic artifacts like baskets and tools.

This groundbreaking discovery opens new avenues for understanding human history and fashion in ancient Europe.
