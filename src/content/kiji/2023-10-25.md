# Japan's Supreme Court Declares Forced Sterilization Unconstitutional in Transgender Rights Case

In a landmark decision, Japan's Supreme Court has ruled that the existing requirement for sterilization surgery for people seeking legal gender change is unconstitutional. The unanimous verdict, issued by the 15-judge Grand Bench, has been praised as a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.

The plaintiff, a transgender woman "under 50," had been denied a legal gender change because she did not undergo sterilization surgery, as mandated by Japanese law. She argued that the procedure would impose both a physical and economic burden on her, and infringe upon her constitutional rights to pursue happiness and be free from discrimination.

While the court has sent the case back to a lower court for further examination, it acknowledged that the existing rules force individuals to make a difficult choice between undergoing surgery and forgoing gender change.
