# Alexei Navalny Disappears from Russian Prison, Allies Alarmed

In a concerning development, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has reportedly vanished from the penal colony where he was imprisoned. Navalny's team announced on Monday that his current location remains unknown following his expected transfer to a more severe "special regime" colony.

Navalny, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been serving time since last year after being convicted in a controversial embezzlement case, widely seen as politically motivated. His team had been anticipating his move to the harsher prison facility after an August sentence, but the lack of information regarding his whereabouts has raised alarms among his supporters and international observers.

The Russian prison service has not provided any details on Navalny's transfer or current location, further intensifying concerns for his safety and well-being. This disappearance marks the latest episode in a series of repressive measures against opposition figures in Russia, drawing widespread condemnation and calls for transparency from global human rights organizations.

The situation remains tense as the world watches for any updates on Navalny's fate, reflecting the broader issues of political repression and human rights in Russia.
