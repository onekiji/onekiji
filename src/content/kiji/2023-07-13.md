# North Korea Launches Hwasong-18 ICBM Amidst Tensions with the U.S.

North Korea has confirmed the test-launch of a Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), marking its first ICBM launch in three months. The launch was described by North Korean state media as a warning against U.S. and allies' military activity in the region.

The missile, fired from the capital region, travelled approximately 1,000 km at a maximum altitude of 6,000 km before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The 74-minute flight is the longest recorded for a North Korean missile, exceeding the previous record of 71 minutes set by the liquid-fuel Hwasong-17 ICBM last year.

South Korea, Japan, and the United States have condemned the test, with the United Nations Security Council set to convene a meeting to discuss the launch. North Korea's action has been branded a grave provocation in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.

The missile test follows a recent escalation of rhetoric from North Korea. Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, issued a stern warning against the planned deployment of a U.S. nuclear missile submarine in the region and threatened to shoot down alleged U.S. spy planes.

Despite international condemnation, North Korea continues to expand its military capabilities. Earlier this year, it attempted to put its first military spy satellite into orbit, a mission which ended in failure but North Korea has vowed to try again.

Analysts anticipate the display of North Korea's latest military hardware in late July during the celebration of the Korean War armistice, known in the country as Victory Day.
