# China Tightens Grip on Tech Metal Exports in U.S. Semiconductor Showdown

China's Commerce Ministry has announced plans to control exports of specific metals critical to the semiconductor industry. This marks the latest development in the escalating tech standoff between Beijing and the United States. Starting August 1, China will require exporters to obtain permissions for the shipment of certain gallium and germanium products. These metals play a significant role in the manufacture of high-tech microchips.

This move comes as the United States is considering implementing new restrictions on chip shipments to China. Concurrently, the U.S. and the Netherlands are also planning to impose additional limits on sales of chipmaking equipment to China this summer. The aim is to prevent the technology from bolstering China's military. 

The Chinese controls encompass eight gallium-related and six germanium-related products. Penalties will be put in place for unauthorized or excessive exports. These metals are also crucial in other areas of technology, such as infrared, fibre optics, and solar cells.
