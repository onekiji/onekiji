# Ukraine Ups Drone Attacks as Conflict with Russia Intensifies

Ukraine's war with Russia has escalated, with Ukrainian drones hitting targets within Russian borders, causing alarm among residents in Moscow. The latest strikes on Sunday targeted a business and shopping development in the west of the capital, damaging two floors of a 50-story building. While no casualties were reported, the attack has brought the conflict closer to those who previously felt it was distant.

Earlier, Russian missiles struck an apartment block and Ukraine's security service building in the city of Dnipro, injuring nine people. The residential building was newly completed and unoccupied, thus avoiding a higher casualty count.

Russia's Defense Ministry reported intercepting three drones, claiming it also thwarted a Ukrainian missile attack in the southern city of Taganrog and downed a military drone near Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukraine's ground forces are reportedly holding their defensive lines against constant Russian advances.

On the humanitarian front, Qatar has pledged $100 million in aid to Ukraine for health, education, and demining efforts. Ukraine's president's chief of staff has called on the international community to condemn Russia's alleged threats to civilian vessels in the Black Sea.

In an effort to negotiate peace, the Egyptian President urged Russia to revive the Black Sea grain deal. Concurrently, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed that Moscow is carefully studying a peace proposal made by African leaders.

Despite the ongoing conflict, the International Olympic Committee has extended a special invitation to Ukrainian fencer Olha Kharlan to participate in the Paris Olympics next year.

The conflict continues to impact civilian life on both sides, with authorities on high alert and peace negotiations ongoing.
