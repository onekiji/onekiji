# IAEA Reports Iran's Advancements in Nuclear Enrichment Amidst Stonewalling

Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear enrichment program, accumulating enough uranium enriched to up to 60% purity for three atomic bombs, as per the latest International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports. This level of enrichment, close to weapons-grade, marks a substantial increase from previous figures and is a concerning development in the global context.

The confidential IAEA reports, revealed on Wednesday, indicate that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium has grown to 128.3 kg, surpassing the theoretical threshold of 42 kg needed for a nuclear bomb. Despite this alarming accumulation, Iran continues to deny aspirations for nuclear weapons, asserting its program is for peaceful purposes.

Interestingly, the rate of enrichment to 60% purity has slowed down, possibly due to indirect negotiations with the United States, leading to a prisoner exchange in September. However, tensions between Iran and the IAEA have escalated, with Iran hindering investigations into uranium traces found at undeclared sites and limiting the agency's monitoring capabilities.

The IAEA's concerns extend beyond enrichment levels to Iran's non-cooperation in clarifying the origin of manmade uranium particles at undeclared locations. Iran's response to international criticism included barring experienced IAEA inspectors, a move described as "extreme and unjustified" by the agency.

As the situation unfolds, global powers, including the U.S., continue to press Iran to reverse its nuclear course. President Joe Biden has expressed willingness to re-enter a nuclear deal, but formal talks have been stalled since August 2022. The IAEA director-general warns that Iran possesses enough enriched uranium for several bombs, heightening tensions in the already volatile Middle East region.
