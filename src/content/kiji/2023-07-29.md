# Niger Faces Economic Pressure as Western Countries Withdraw Aid in Response to Military Coup

In response to a military coup that toppled Niger's democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum, both the European Union and France have suspended financial aid to the country, and the United States has indicated it may follow suit. The coup was led by General Abdourahamane Tiani, who was previously in charge of the presidential guard.

Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, relies heavily on external aid, receiving nearly $2 billion annually in official development assistance. It is a key security partner for the US and France, which use the country as a base for combatting the ongoing Islamist insurgency in the Sahel region.

The EU and France demand an immediate return to constitutional order, reinstating Bazoum as president. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that significant assistance to Niger is "clearly in jeopardy".

The EU and France provide hundreds of millions of dollars in security, development aid, and support for governance, education, and sustainable growth. Their actions could lead to a halt of externally-funded projects and a significant economic downturn in Niger.

This coup, which has sparked international outcry, follows recent power grabs in the Sahel region, including in Mali and Burkina Faso. The African Union has given the military a 15-day ultimatum to restore constitutional order, while the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to discuss further economic and financial sanctions. The response of the coup leaders to this international pressure remains uncertain.
