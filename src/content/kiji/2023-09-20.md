# Azerbaijan and Armenia Ceasefire Reached in Nagorno-Karabakh Following

In a significant development, Azerbaijan has ceased its military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but largely populated by ethnic Armenians. The ceasefire comes after a 24-hour operation led by Azerbaijani forces against ethnic Armenian troops in the region.

President Ilham Aliyev hailed the Azerbaijani army's efforts, stating that the country's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh has been restored. The military action led to intense clashes, with conflicting reports on casualties. Armenian officials reported at least 32 deaths and 200 injuries, while a separatist human rights official claimed higher figures.

The cessation of hostilities was agreed upon with the involvement of Russian peacekeepers and will require the disbanding and disarming of local Karabakh forces. In Armenia, thousands protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's handling of the situation, demanding his resignation.

Both sides are now working on the terms of the truce, which has international attention focused on ensuring a lasting peace in the region.
