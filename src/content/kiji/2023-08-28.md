# Pope Francis Criticizes 'Reactionary' US Catholic Church

Pope Francis has expressed concern over the state of the Catholic Church in the United States, describing it as "reactionary" and noting that political ideology has, in some instances, supplanted faith. The Pope's remarks come amid heightened scrutiny over the Church's role in American politics.

The pontiff criticized the U.S. Church for a "very strong reactionary attitude," claiming that some members have failed to understand that there is an appropriate separation between ideology and faith. He emphasized the importance of keeping faith at the forefront, suggesting that the Church should not be used as a platform for political agendas.

Pope Francis' comments add to ongoing debates about the involvement of religious institutions in politics, particularly in the United States. They also come in the wake of his 10th anniversary as the leader of the global Catholic Church. His observations serve as a clarion call for reflection and possible reform within the American Catholic community.
