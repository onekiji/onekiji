# Ecuador Presidential Candidate Fernando Villavicencio Assassinated Amid Rising Crime

Ecuadorian presidential candidate and national assembly member, Fernando Villavicencio, known for his campaigns against corruption and his allegations of links between organized crime and government officials, was tragically assassinated after a campaign rally in Quito.

The notorious gang "Los Lobos", which has ties to the Mexico-based Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), has claimed responsibility for the attack. This event strikes just weeks before the presidential elections, with national security and crime being paramount concerns on the agenda.

Historically considered a safe haven in Latin America, Ecuador has recently seen a surge in crime, heavily influenced by the Colombian and Mexican drug cartels. Due to its strategic position between the major narcotics producers of Colombia and Peru, Ecuador has become a significant hub for drug trafficking routes.

This escalating security situation is causing an exodus, with many Ecuadorians opting to emigrate in hopes of finding safety. The US Ambassador to Ecuador, Michael J. Fitzpatrick, has vehemently condemned the assassination and offered US assistance in the ensuing investigation.
