# Alexei Navalny, Russian Opposition Leader, Faces Additional 19 Years in Prison

Prominent Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, has been sentenced to an additional 19 years in prison on extremism charges, following a closed-door trial in a penal colony 260 kilometers from Moscow. Navalny, who was already serving nearly a 12-year sentence for fraud, contempt of court, and other charges, was found guilty of founding and financing an extremist organization and trivializing Nazism. The charges are linked to his now-defunct political movement.

Navalny's associate, Daniel Kholodny, was also sentenced to eight years for participating in an extremist community and financing extremist activities. Both Navalny and Kholodny have been vocal about their sentences, urging Russians to resist the Kremlin and not be intimidated by their sentences.

This latest verdict has been widely condemned by the international community, with the European Union and the United Nations rights chief calling for Navalny's immediate release. The United States has also expressed concern over the lack of due process and the secretive nature of the trial.

Navalny, a former lawyer and anti-corruption activist, was the victim of a near-fatal poisoning in 2020 with a Soviet-era nerve agent, an act that the West blames on Russia's intelligence agency. Despite these challenges, Navalny continues to criticize the Kremlin from his prison cell, particularly its role in the invasion of Ukraine.

This additional sentence comes amid an intensifying crackdown on dissent in Russia, following the country's invasion of Ukraine.
