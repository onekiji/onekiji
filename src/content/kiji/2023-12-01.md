# Hancock Reflects on Covid Measures and School Closures

In a recent Covid inquiry, former Health Secretary Matt Hancock highlighted that the delay in implementing a lockdown in late 2020 contributed to the necessity of school closures in January 2021. Hancock, reflecting on the government's Covid response, indicated that earlier action could have mitigated the impact on educational institutions.

WhatsApp messages from October 2020 reveal Hancock's concerns about then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak's approach, suggesting economic considerations were influencing pandemic measures. This revelation comes amidst ongoing scrutiny of the government's handling of the pandemic, with a focus on the balance between public health and economic stability.

Hancock's testimony provides insight into the complex decision-making processes during a critical phase of the pandemic, emphasizing the challenges faced in prioritizing health concerns over economic pressures.
