# EU Reiterates Strong Support for Ukraine Amid Internal Tensions

In a significant diplomatic move, the European Union's foreign policy chief led a delegation on an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, aiming to underscore the bloc's long-term commitment to Ukraine. The visit comes amid growing concerns about political tensions within the EU over its continued support for Ukraine's struggle against Russia.

Though largely symbolic, the meeting between EU and Ukrainian diplomats served as a strong reaffirmation of the EU's commitment to Ukraine. The EU's top diplomat dismissed concerns about the bloc's long-term support, describing it as unwavering.

This diplomatic gesture stands in contrast to recent reports suggesting internal disagreements within the EU on its Ukraine policy. However, the latest developments indicate that the EU is keen to present a united front in its support for Ukraine, particularly in its ongoing conflict with Russia.
