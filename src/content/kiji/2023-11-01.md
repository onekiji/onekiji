# Israeli Strikes Claim Second Hamas Leader as Civilians Evacuate to Egypt

In a significant development in the ongoing conflict, Israeli forces have conducted another airstrike on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, killing a second Hamas leader. The military confirmed the operation, stating it as part of their offensive against Hamas militants.

While military actions escalate, the first group of civilian evacuees from the besieged Gaza Strip has successfully crossed into Egypt. The move comes as relief efforts intensify to aid those caught in the crossfire.

On the ground, families continue to endure the hardships of war. Residents like Kamal Masoud and his family, who reside in the Jabalya camp, describe the harrowing experiences of living through airstrikes, highlighting the human toll of the conflict.

As both sides of the battle show no signs of backing down, international communities call for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful resolution.
