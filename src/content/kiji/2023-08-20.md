# British Columbia Grapples with Historic Wildfires; State of Emergency Declared

British Columbia (BC) has declared a state of emergency as the region faces the worst wildfire season in its history. Thousands have been forced to evacuate, with fires tearing through both BC and areas south of the Canada-U.S. border.

In Kelowna and West Kelowna, fires have burned homes and woodland, prompting emergency declarations. Similarly, in Spokane County, Washington, over 185 structures have been destroyed by the fires, and one fatality has been confirmed.

BC Premier David Eby described the wildfire season as the province's "worst" and stressed the unpredictable nature of the situation. Over 15,000 people have been ordered to evacuate across the province, with an additional 20,000 under evacuation alert.

Authorities have cautioned against nonessential travel to affected areas to keep roads clear for emergency personnel. Federal assistance and support from 13 countries have been mobilized, with BC accounting for over a third of Canada's active fires.

Residents and businesses are feeling the impact, with reports of obscured visibility and property damage. The fires have expanded rapidly, leading to evacuations and power outages in various areas. The situation remains dynamic, with authorities closely monitoring the fires' progression.
