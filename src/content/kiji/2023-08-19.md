# US, South Korea, and Japan Condemn China's Actions, Deepen Ties at Camp David

In a historic trilateral summit at Camp David, U.S. President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida displayed unity in condemning China's "dangerous and aggressive behavior" in the South China Sea. The leaders agreed to deepen their military and economic cooperation, marking a bold step given the past tensions between South Korea and Japan.

The summit, taking place just five months after Kishida and Yoon's formal talks in Tokyo, showcased a surprising camaraderie. Their commitments include annual trilateral summits, joint military training exercises, and real-time information sharing on North Korean missile activities.

President Biden emphasized the significance of the meeting, stating, "If I seem like I'm happy, it's because I am." The choice of Camp David as the meeting venue underscores the importance attached to these discussions. While the immediate outcomes are clear, only time will determine the lasting historical impact of this summit.
