# Magnitude 7.5 Earthquake Hits Philippines, Tsunami Alert Lifted

A powerful earthquake, registering at magnitude 7.5, struck the southern region of Mindanao in the Philippines on Saturday night, initially triggering tsunami warnings in both the Philippines and Japan. The U.S. Tsunami Warning System initially warned of potential waves up to 3 meters above sea level. However, authorities later lifted the tsunami alert, assuring that the risk of large waves had passed. Evacuations were carried out in the affected regions as a precautionary measure. The situation remains under close observation by local and international agencies.
