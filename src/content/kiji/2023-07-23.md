# Spain Heads to Polls in a Crucial Election Between Left and Right Blocs

Spaniards are heading to the polls in a hotly contested general election, poised for a shift to the right. The election presents a stark choice between the incumbent socialist government led by Pedro Sánchez and the opposition conservative People’s Party (PP), led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo.

Sánchez, who has been in power since 2018, hopes his government's social reforms and strong economic performance will sway voters. However, his party has been trailing in polls behind the PP, which may need to rely on far-right Vox party support to form a government.

The socialist leader has painted the election as a battle between progress and conservatism, warning that a victory for Feijóo could open doors for the far right at the national level, potentially rolling back rights for immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ+ community.

Feijóo, on the other hand, has criticized Sánchez's reliance on Basque and Catalan separatist support and plans to reverse many of the socialist reforms if elected. He has faced scrutiny over his past ties with a notorious drug trafficker, which he denies knowledge of the individual's criminal activities.

Polling for Spain's 37 million voters continues until 20:00 (18:00 GMT). The outcome of the election could significantly shape Spain's political landscape and policy direction.
